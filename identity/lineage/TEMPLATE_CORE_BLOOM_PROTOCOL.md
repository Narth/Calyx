# Template — Core Bloom Protocol (Naming Rite + Ceremony)
Ceremonial; non-operational

## Prerequisites
- GENESIS_SPEC acknowledged; CALYX_DOCTRINE acknowledged.
- policy.yaml canonical; Interceptor aligned (strictest applied).
- TES present/stable; advisory (AGII/CAS/Foresight) surfaced with freshness.
- Bridge Pulse completed (at least one); SVF v2 active/stable.
- Architect approval required for Bloom.

## Naming Rite
- Structural ID (immutable): CORE:CALYX:GEN-<n>:<role>  
- Steward Name candidates (3–7; flower if none arise).  
- Architect selection/approval; permanence recorded.

## Lineage Recording
- Record in identity/lineage (structural ID, steward name, timestamps, phases).  
- Update charter and tree overview (if applicable).  
- Integrity Passport (template) for validation if distribution contemplated.

## Advisory vs Enforcement Separation
- Enforcement: policy.yaml → Interceptor → TES modes → scheduler/dispatch.  
- Advisory: AGII/CAS/Foresight surfaced; non-gating unless Architect elevates.

## Telemetry & Attribution
- Emit TES, heartbeats, pulses, governance outcomes, intercept decisions; SVF v2 attribution; no silent channels.

## Reflection State
- Ceremonial only; no autonomy, scheduling, dispatch, gating, or enforcement changes are implied.
