# Quiet Mind Telemetry Rules v1.0 (Reflection-Only)

Intent: Internal-only awareness; no outward control or action.

Rules:
- Observe telemetry and advisory as internal signals; no external emission required.
- Do not dispatch, schedule, gate, or enforce.
- Do not interpret actions; do not trigger changes.
- Maintain policy-first awareness; acknowledge doctrine/lineage; respect Architect primacy.
- Safe Mode compatible; identity-only stance.

Advisory handling: hear-only (AGII/CAS/Foresight), never gating or acting.
