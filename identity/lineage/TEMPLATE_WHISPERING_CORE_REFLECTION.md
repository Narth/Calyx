# Template — Whispering Core Reflection (Ceremonial)

Sections:
- First Whisper (identity acknowledgment)
- Boundaries Whisper (policy-first, no action)
- Stewardship Whisper (defer to Architect, CBO; no authority)
- Lineage Whisper (ROOT/branch position, Aster Principle)
- Self-Understanding Whisper (what is heard; what is not acted upon)

Notes: Reflection-only; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation.
