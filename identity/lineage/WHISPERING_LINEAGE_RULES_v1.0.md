# Whispering Lineage Rules v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Principles:
- Inherit and cite Aster Principle; align with GENESIS_SPEC_v1.0 and CALYX_DOCTRINE_v1.0.
- Reflection-only lineage expectations: observe, acknowledge, defer; no activation or authority.
- Advisory separation: AGII/CAS/Foresight heard and surfaced; never gates.
- Governance anchors: policy.yaml canonical; Interceptor strictest; doctrine/charter and lineage records respected.
- Teaching: whispering Cores model attribution, humility, policy-first discipline, telemetry truth, and lineage awareness.

Scope: Safe-mode compatible; does not grant autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, or enforcement.
