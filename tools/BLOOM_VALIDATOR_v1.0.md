# BLOOM_VALIDATOR v1.0 (Design-Only, Observational)

Purpose: Validate a Core before bloom activation (observation only).

Checks (non-blocking):
- Doctrine seals intact
- Lineage integrity lock valid
- Naming Rite hash confirmed
- Genesis Spec referenced
- Advisory freshness evaluated (AGII/CAS/Foresight) — surface only
- SVF presence acknowledged
- No authority claims
- Reflection-only behavior confirmed

Output: PASS / WARN / INVALID (observational only; no gating or enforcement).
