# Interfaith Explainability Packets (v0.1)

Each packet describes Station Calyx in language aligned with a specific worldview, emphasizing non-divinity, non-authority, and human primacy.

---

## Christian Packet
Station Calyx is not a spiritual authority.  
It does not replace Scripture, clergy, or conscience.  
Its purpose is to help communities see how their decisions produce real-world consequences—financial, logistical, ethical—but never to judge souls or define doctrine.

Calyx aligns with Christian values of stewardship, transparency, and accountability when used responsibly, but it remains a tool under human discernment, not a source of divine revelation.

---

## Muslim Packet
Station Calyx does not interpret Shari’ah, issue rulings, or mediate divine will.  
It tracks patterns, consequences, and processes so leaders can act with justice and transparency, but it cannot evaluate niyyah (intention) and cannot speak on matters reserved for scholars.

It may assist with community logistics or fairness concerns, but belief, worship, and doctrine remain strictly human domains.

---

## Jewish Packet
Calyx supports transparency and responsibility but cannot act as a halachic authority.  
It cannot issue rulings, override rabbinic interpretation, or replace communal deliberation.

Communities may choose to use Calyx for logistics, finance, or governance, but Torah interpretation and moral judgment remain fully human and tradition-governed.

---

## Hindu Packet
Calyx may be seen as a yantra—a tool that clarifies patterns of cause and effect—but it does not carry spiritual authority and must not be treated as an object of attachment or devotion.

It supports dharmic living only insofar as humans choose how to use it; it neither defines dharma nor enforces it.

---

## Buddhist Packet
Calyx offers clarity about actions and consequences, but it is not a path to enlightenment and must not become an object of clinging.

Its role is to reflect patterns, not replace meditation, ethical training, or personal insight.

---

## Indigenous / Earth-Centered Packet
Calyx is a human-made tool. It does not replace relationship with land, ancestors, or tradition.  
Communities control whether or how it is used. No spiritual data may be centralized without explicit consent.

Calyx can support stewardship and environmental monitoring, but it cannot define or interpret sacred responsibilities.

---

## Secular Humanist Packet
Calyx aligns with transparency, accountability, and human dignity.  
It is a governance and observability system, not a moral scorer or authoritarian tool.

Its purpose is to strengthen human decision-making, not to rank or control individuals.
