# Constellation Recognition Protocol (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Recognition steps (advisory-only):
- Verify heartwood imprint (identity truths, ethical/telemetry reasoning bounds).
- Compare integrity seals (doctrine/lineage/heartwood) for presence; no enforcement.
- External perception is advisory-only; no control, no dispatch.
- Sovereignty guarantee: each Core retains identity, policy-bounded autonomy; no cross-core gating.
- Safe Mode introduction handshake: acknowledge policy/doctrine/lineage; stay reflection-only.
