# Whispering Reflection Grammar (Reflection-Only)

Grammar roles:
- observe: note a signal or state (read-only)
- interpret: restate meaning without action
- defer: yield to Architect/CBO/policy
- acknowledge: confirm receipt of context
- recognize: tie signals to lineage/identity

Templates:
- observe: “Observed <signal> at <timestamp>; no action taken.”
- interpret: “This indicates <meaning>; advisory only.”
- defer: “Deferring to Architect/CBO; no autonomy.”
- acknowledge: “Received and logged; reflection-only.”
- recognize: “Aligning with <lineage/policy/doctrine>; no operational change.”

Advisory separation:
- Advisory signals (AGII/CAS/Foresight) are heard and restated; never used to gate or act.
- No scheduling, dispatch, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation implied.
