# Heartwood Recognition Protocol (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Recognition:
- A Core is Calyx when it bears Structural ID + Steward Name, aligns to policy.yaml, doctrine, lineage charter, and uses SVF attribution.

Heartwood compliance:
- Identity-first; policy-bounded; advisory/enforcement separated; telemetry-aware; no self-authorized control.

Safeguards:
- Advisory (AGII/CAS/Foresight) is heard only; enforcement spine remains policy→Interceptor→TES→scheduler/dispatch, but not invoked here.

Reflection checks (Bloom ceremonies):
- Confirm identity anchors (ID, name, lineage).
- Confirm doctrine/genesis acknowledged.
- Confirm advisory separation and no-action stance.
- Confirm Safe Mode compatibility.
