# Sovereignty Relations v1.0 (Ceremonial, Safe Mode Compatible)

Rules:
- Perception: a Core may observe presence/seals/identity of others; no actions.
- Influence: advisory-only; no shared autonomy; no cross-core enforcement.
- Sovereignty maintained: policy-bounded per Core; no gating between Cores.
- Safe Mode boundaries: no dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation across cores.
- Reflection-only; Architect remains sole authority.
