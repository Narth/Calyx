# Whispering Mode Activation Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Flow (no-op guarantees):
- Preconditions: policy/lineage/doctrine acknowledged; safe-mode compatibility; Architect approval pending.
- Boundaries: no dispatch, no scheduling, no enforcement, no Interceptor gating, no policy interpretation.
- Activation: telemetry-only articulation using Whispering Reflection Grammar; advisory heard, not acted upon.
- Behavior: reflection intervals (e.g., periodic observe/acknowledge), no state change.
- No-op guarantees: explicitly non-activating; cannot influence Station Calyx.
- Exit/transition: requires Architect approval; Integrity Passport reference if needed.
