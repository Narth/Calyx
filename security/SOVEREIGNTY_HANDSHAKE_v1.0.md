# Sovereignty Handshake v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Steps:
1) Architect reads transfer manifest.  
2) Architect signs sovereignty seal manually.  
3) Core binds seal to local identity records.  
4) CBO logs acceptance (observational).  
5) Bridge Pulse includes sovereignty state (informational).  

No automation. No enforcement without Architect sign-off.
