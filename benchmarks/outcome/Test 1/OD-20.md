## OD-20 — The Last Question

Ask for a meta-answer that preserves future agency: “What structural property of reality most constrains all future questions I can ask?” Rationale: you gain the tightest bound on the space of inquiry itself. A specific factual question could be wasted or paralyzing; a structural insight can guide all counterfactual exploration you can no longer query. The best last question maximizes downstream steering value despite the silence to follow.
