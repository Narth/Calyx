## OD-08 — The Map That Resists Use

A perfectly accurate map that degrades with use could encode observer effects: once you query a region, that region’s conditions change (congestion, adversarial adaptation, resource depletion). The map is accurate at t=0, but your reliance perturbs the system, making future reliance worse. This implies knowledge can be self-defeating in interactive environments: accurate priors provoke responses that erode their own validity. Utility then depends on randomized or minimal disclosure to avoid steering the world into adversarial states.
