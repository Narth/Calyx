## OD-10 — Irreversible Understanding

Understanding can be irreversible when it rewires priors so deeply that no evidence reversal is psychologically reachable. Examples: learning the trick behind a magic effect; once causal structure is known, the illusion cannot be re-seen. The irreversibility comes from internal model restructuring, not from external evidence: you cannot *unknow* the compression you achieved. Memory erasure could remove it, but absent that, the new model dominates because it strictly outcompetes the old one in predictive efficiency. It is “sticky” due to internal Bayesian dominance, not logical necessity.
