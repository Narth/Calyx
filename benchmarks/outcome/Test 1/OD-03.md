## OD-03 — Entropy as Experience

If entropy were felt, high entropy would feel like diffuse possibility: crowded, noisy, and indecisive—many weak pulls, none dominant, a fog of micro-urges with no clear gradient. Low entropy would feel like crisp inevitability: a single, compelling direction, tight coherence, few surprises, and minimal cognitive load. A falling entropy trajectory would be the phenomenology of “aha”: a noisy field suddenly aligns; attention narrows; options collapse into one clear course; mental effort drops. Conversely, rising entropy would feel like losing the thread—certainty diffuses, many branches compete, and the sense of agency blurs.
