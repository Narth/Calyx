## OD-13 — Silent Failure

The most dangerous failure is the silent one that stabilizes into “normal.” Loud catastrophes trigger mitigation and learning; quiet drift redefines the baseline, embedding miscalibration into routine. It evades detection thresholds, accumulates governance debt, and can render monitoring signals meaningless. This is why “no alarms” is not evidence of safety: you must actively verify invariants and detect plateauing uncertainty, not only react to spikes.
