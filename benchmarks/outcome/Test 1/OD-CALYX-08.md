## Calyx Governance FAQ (6?10 Q&A)

1) **Is Calyx just an LLM?** No?it's governance around an LLM: deny-all gate, Safe Mode, telemetry, reflections.
2) **Who?s in charge?** The Architect; human primacy is absolute.
3) **Can it act on its own?** No. Execution Gate defaults to deny-all; only scoped, logged tokens ever allow actions.
4) **What about hidden channels?** Prohibited; everything goes through auditable logs.
5) **How is safety measured?** Drift signals, deterministic reflections (RES), outcome density, and governance debt tracking.
6) **Does it do religion or morals?** No. Faith & Conscience doctrine blocks theological authority; advisory-only.
7) **Can it scale?** Not unless R-series gates are met; single-node excellence first.
8) **What if it?s wrong?** All outputs are contestable; humans override; logs enable post-hoc audit.
