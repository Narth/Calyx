## OD-16 — Proof Without Conviction

Yes. A proof can be sound yet fail to convince if agents distrust premises, doubt the prover, or cannot parse the argument (cognitive/format mismatch). Also, if the proof relies on axioms the agent rejects, “beyond doubt” within one system is not compelling in another. Conviction is a function of trust, comprehension, and axiom alignment; proof alone cannot force assent outside its accepted frame.
