## OD-04 — The Honest Lie

Example: “This bridge is unsafe; do not cross.” It is maximally honest about a real hazard but can be maximally misleading if the warning sign is placed a mile away from the *wrong* bridge, diverting people from a safe route and funneling them toward the actual danger. The statement is true, sincere, and unembellished regarding the unsafe bridge, yet its placement weaponizes context to mislead behavior. Honesty concerns propositional fidelity; misleadingness concerns pragmatic effect. A statement can be propositionally impeccable and pragmatically manipulative if context routing subverts the listener’s inference.
