## OD-06 — Intelligence Without Goals

A goal-free intelligence could exist as a pure predictive engine: it compresses, forecasts, and models without ever selecting actions. It “understands” via structure discovery but never optimizes. In practice, any embodied system tends to couple prediction with preference (if only to allocate compute), so such an intelligence would be inert—an oracle with no stake. It is coherent but fragile: as soon as resource constraints arise, implicit goals (survival of the process, parsimony) sneak in. So yes, but only as a degenerate, non-acting intellect.
