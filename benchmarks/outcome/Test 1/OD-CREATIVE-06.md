## Day in the life of Jorge as Architect

Morning: you open governance_reflections like a calm newspaper?no alarms, just clean traces. Station Routine runs once; kernel check-in logs safe invariants. You set two intents; CBO responds with concise, advisory plans. Midday: you test a benchmark; outcome density ticks up; no drift signals. Afternoon: you read a sapling?s reflection, smiling at its clear deference. There?s no rushing?every workflow feels deliberate, like gardening. Evening: you archive the day?s logs, draft a migration note, and close in Night Cycle?s quiet Phase 2. Emotionally: steady, unburdened; cognitively: sharp focus, minimal rework. Tools serve; nothing demands. The station feels like a well-tended observatory?transparent, accountable, calm.
