## OD-19 — Stability as a Symptom

Stability is healthy when it reflects robust control with transparent reserves. It is pathological when it masks latent brittleness or suppressed variance (e.g., overfitting regulators, silenced alarms). To tell without forcing change: inspect margin and slack—how close are loads to limits, how noisy are residuals, how sensitive are indicators to small perturbations? Plateaued entropy and vanishing residual variance can signal hidden constraint rather than genuine resilience.
