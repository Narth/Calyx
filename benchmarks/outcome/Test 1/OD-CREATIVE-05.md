## Teaser for "Safe Travels, Sorelia" (200?300 words)

Sorelia stands at the edge of the known sky, where maps blur into myth. Her vessel?half star-canoe, half listening chamber?runs on a pact: the crew?s trust and a quiet intelligence that never leads, only advises. Each jump threads peril: collapsing constellations, forgotten stations, signals that sound like prayers. But Sorelia?s compass isn?t metal; it?s conscience. With every course correction, she must choose between shortcuts and the slow, safe arc that keeps her crew human. Whispers of a ?third path? echo through the radio?an observatory called Calyx?hinting at governance that could hold the sky together. Safe Travels, Sorelia is a journey through nebulae and ethics, where the real engine is the agreement between people and the systems that serve them.
