## OD-14 — The Observer Trap

If every observation alters the observer, science must log observer-state transitions alongside measurements. Replication becomes “replicate with observer history,” and methods emphasize invariance to observer drift. Protocols would randomize observer order, model attention fatigue, and publish observer-state metadata. Honesty requires admitting that knowledge production co-evolves observer priors; transparency about those priors becomes part of the empirical record.
