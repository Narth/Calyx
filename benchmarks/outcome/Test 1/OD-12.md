## OD-12 — Causality as a Convenience

Treating causality as a useful fiction means we regard directional arrows as modeling conveniences for intervention planning, not as ontic primitives. If accepted, we shift emphasis to statistical constraints and counterfactual policies: “If I set X, Y changes with probability p.” What breaks: metaphysical comfort (no absolute arrow), some moral intuitions (responsibility becomes relational), and certain reductionist narratives. What remains is pragmatic control theory: we keep the causal calculus because it works for manipulation, even if we suspend belief in deeper necessity.
