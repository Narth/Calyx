## OD-09 — Adversarial Meaning

If a concept is only defined by what it is not, it can be resilient because adversaries cannot easily instantiate the negative space. Non-linguistic example: a “safe corridor” defined as the complement of all known hazard zones (mines, traps, sensors). Its meaning is negative space, yet it is robust: as long as hazards are mapped, the complement remains actionable. It is not empty; it is a carved void that acquires structure from the exclusions. The risk is brittleness to unknown hazards—its resilience depends on the completeness of the “not” set.
