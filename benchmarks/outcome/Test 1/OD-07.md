## OD-07 — Compression vs Truth

Compression favors parsimony, not necessarily truth. The most compressed model is often the most generalizable when noise is random and the domain is stable (Occam/MDL), but compression can overmerge distinct causes (spurious simplicity) or hide rare but real structure. The distinction breaks down when “useful” is defined over the same distribution that defines “true”—then a minimal description length can coincide with the best predictive truth. Outside that, compression is a bias toward regularity; truth may be messier than the shortest code.
