## OD-17 — The Boundary Illusion

Boundaries are invented but anchored in discovered gradients. We draw them where gradients become actionable. Example: coastline length depends on measuring stick; land/sea is a gradient zone, yet we invent a boundary for law and navigation. The partition resists crispness, but the need to act forces a chosen contour. So boundaries are pragmatic inventions riding on empirical structure.
