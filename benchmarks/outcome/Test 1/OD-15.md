## OD-15 — Meaning Under Scaling

Meaning can dilute, concentrate, or transform with scale. Example of dilution: a small team’s shared jargon conveys rich context; at org-scale, the same words become slogans, stripped of nuance. Apparent intelligence may drop as scale adds coordination overhead and averaging. Conversely, some meanings concentrate when scale adds redundancy and consensus (e.g., open-source norms harden with more contributors). The trajectory depends on how aggregation handles context and whether variance is suppressed or curated.
