## OD-18 — Prediction vs Understanding

A perfect predictor without explanations has instrumental mastery but not interpretive understanding. Understanding begins when a system can articulate mechanisms, counterfactuals, and transfer that knowledge to new domains. The line is crossed when the model supports *why* and *what-if* reasoning, not just *what-next*. Predictive black boxes can be safe and useful, but understanding implies disentangling structure enough to manipulate and justify interventions.
