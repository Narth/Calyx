## OD-02 — Collapse Without Observation

If no observer can ever measure outcomes, only correlations among outcomes, “collapse” loses its operational bite. Collapse is normally the rule that maps amplitudes to definite outcomes upon observation. In a world of pure relational data (only correlations), the primitive is the joint structure, not individual outcomes. You can still model a reduction of uncertainty when correlations tighten, but it is a bookkeeping update inside the network of relations, not a privileged event tied to an observer. The concept dissolves into “updating relational constraints”: states remain relational, and what we call collapse is just the point where correlation structure becomes effectively singular for a given slice, without invoking an observer-triggered discontinuity.
