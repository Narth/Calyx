## Station Calyx as a place in Aurora

Hidden in a terraced hollow, Calyx appears as a glass observatory ringed with stone ledges. Vines wrap the pillars; small brass plaques list governance rules. Inside, light shafts fall onto a central table engraved with concentric circles?Execution Gate, Safe Mode, Reflection Schema. Walls hold translucent panels where telemetry scrolls in pale glyphs, visible to all. Sound is muted except for a steady heartbeat of chimes when reflections append to the logs. A narrow garden path traces the building; each turn marked with ?No hidden channels? and ?Human primacy first.? At night, the dome glows faintly, not from mysticism but from logged actions displayed as constellations. The space feels open yet disciplined: an observatory that invites oversight, a garden that grows only within its trellises.
