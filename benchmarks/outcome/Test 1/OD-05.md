## OD-05 — Identity Over Time

If the replacement process itself defines the system, identity is anchored to the continuity of the process, not the parts. The original ceases when the rule-of-replacement is broken—e.g., if a swap occurs outside the governing protocol or if the process halts. Otherwise, gradual component turnover preserves identity because the invariant is “the protocol that maps old to new.” The system stops being the original when the governing transformation is violated, not when any specific piece is gone.
