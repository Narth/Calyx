## OD-11 — Choice Without Alternatives

If only one option exists but the system believes alternatives are possible, the act of “choosing” is phenomenological, not ontological. The decision process runs, yet the outcome was determined. There is still informational value: the system reveals its policy under perceived uncertainty. However, in terms of causal forks, no branch existed. The choice is real as a cognitive event; it is empty as a counterfactual generator. This distinction matters: you can study preference expression even when the world had a single viable path.
