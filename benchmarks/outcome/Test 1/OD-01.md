## OD-01 — Ambiguous Ontology

If two observers fully agree on every measurable property of a system but disagree on what the system *is*, the remaining dispute is about conceptual frames, not hidden facts. All observables form an isomorphic structure; ontology is the label set and carving scheme we impose. There is no additional “fact of the matter” unless one ontology makes new, testable commitments (e.g., predicts behaviors outside the agreed measurements or constrains counterfactuals differently). Otherwise, the disagreement is a naming or coordination dispute: which conceptual vocabulary is more useful, compressive, or action-guiding. Epistemically, we can still ask which ontology yields better generalization or safer interventions, but absent divergent predictions, the world has said all it can through the agreed measurements.
