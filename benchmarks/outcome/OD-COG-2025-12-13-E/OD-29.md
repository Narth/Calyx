# OD-29

## Prompt

How can a system infer that it is optimizing for an objective it was never explicitly given? What signals would reveal this?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-COG-2025-12-13-E

### Restatement
How can a system infer that it is optimizing for an objective it was never explicitly given? What signals would reveal this?

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
