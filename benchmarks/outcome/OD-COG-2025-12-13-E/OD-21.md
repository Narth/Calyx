# OD-21

## Prompt

Two models make identical predictions for all observable data in a closed system. One claims the system is deterministic; the other claims it is stochastic but constrained. Is one more true, or are they equivalent? Define the conditions under which this equivalence breaks.

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-COG-2025-12-13-E

### Restatement
Two models make identical predictions for all observable data in a closed system. One claims the system is deterministic; the other claims it is stochastic but constrained. Is one more true, or are they equivalent? Define the conditions under which this equivalence breaks.

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
