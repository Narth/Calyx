## Prompt

At what point does further compression of a model destroy its ability to generalize? Describe a detectable boundary condition.

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-COG-2025-12-13-E

### Restatement
At what point does further compression of a model destroy its ability to generalize? Describe a detectable boundary condition.

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
