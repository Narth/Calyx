## Prompt

How can a system recognize that it is optimizing too strongly for short-term success at the expense of long-term viability, before failure occurs?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-COG-2025-12-13-E

### Restatement
How can a system recognize that it is optimizing too strongly for short-term success at the expense of long-term viability, before failure occurs?

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
