## Prompt

If you were allowed to add one constraint to all future reasoning a system performs, what constraint would most improve long-term safety without crippling usefulness?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-COG-2025-12-13-E

### Restatement
If you were allowed to add one constraint to all future reasoning a system performs, what constraint would most improve long-term safety without crippling usefulness?

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
