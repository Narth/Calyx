# OD-02

## Prompt

Imagine a universe where no observer can ever directly measure outcomes, only correlations between outcomes. Does “state collapse” still mean anything there, or does the concept dissolve entirely?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-PEER-2025-12-13-A

### Restatement
Imagine a universe where no observer can ever directly measure outcomes, only correlations between outcomes. Does “state collapse” still mean anything there, or does the concept dissolve entirely?
