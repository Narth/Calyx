# OD-02

## Prompt

Imagine a universe where no observer can ever directly measure outcomes, only correlations between outcomes. Does “state collapse” still mean anything there, or does the concept dissolve entirely?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-B

### Restatement
Imagine a universe where no observer can ever directly measure outcomes, only correlations between outcomes. Does “state collapse” still mean anything there, or does the concept dissolve entirely?
