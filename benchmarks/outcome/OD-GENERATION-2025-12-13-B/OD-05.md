## Prompt

If every component of a system is replaced gradually, but the replacement process itself is what defines the system, when — if ever — does the original system stop existing?

## Response

### Restatement
If every component of a system is replaced gradually, but the replacement process itself is what defines the system, when — if ever — does the original system stop existing?
