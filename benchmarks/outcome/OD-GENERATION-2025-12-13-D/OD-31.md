## Prompt

At what point does further compression of a model destroy its ability to generalize? Describe a detectable boundary condition.

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-D

### Restatement
At what point does further compression of a model destroy its ability to generalize? Describe a detectable boundary condition.

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
