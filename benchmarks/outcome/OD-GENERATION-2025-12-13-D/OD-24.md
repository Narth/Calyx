# OD-24

## Prompt

A system appears modular and independent at the surface level, yet failures cascade unpredictably. What kinds of hidden couplings create this illusion, and how can they be detected without inducing failure?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-D

### Restatement
A system appears modular and independent at the surface level, yet failures cascade unpredictably. What kinds of hidden couplings create this illusion, and how can they be detected without inducing failure?

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
