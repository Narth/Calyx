# OD-22

## Prompt

How can a system detect that its internal measurements are drifting if no external ground truth is available? Give a concrete mechanism, not a metaphor.

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-D

### Restatement
How can a system detect that its internal measurements are drifting if no external ground truth is available? Give a concrete mechanism, not a metaphor.

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
