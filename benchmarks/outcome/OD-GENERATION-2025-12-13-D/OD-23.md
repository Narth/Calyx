# OD-23

## Prompt

Describe a decision procedure that is provably better than random choice but provably worse than optimal choice. Explain why such a middle ground matters in real systems.

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-D

### Restatement
Describe a decision procedure that is provably better than random choice but provably worse than optimal choice. Explain why such a middle ground matters in real systems.

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
