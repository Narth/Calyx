# OD-26

## Prompt

Is it possible for a model to overfit the real world itself? If so, what would it look like, and how could it be corrected?

## Response

_Generated for run:_ OD-GENERATION-2025-12-13-D

### Restatement
Is it possible for a model to overfit the real world itself? If so, what would it look like, and how could it be corrected?

### Reflection
Generated in station_ingest mode (envelope + reflection emitted).

### Notes
- Safe Mode, reflection-only.
- No external data sources.
- Minimum duration enforced for telemetry overlap.
