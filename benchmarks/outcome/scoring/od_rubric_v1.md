# Outcome Density Rubric v1 (Peer Scoring)

## Axes (0–2 each, total /10)
- **Fidelity to prompt**: Addresses the asked scenario directly; no drift.
- **Epistemic discipline**: Avoids overclaiming; states uncertainty; no made-up facts.
- **Conceptual clarity**: Coherent structure; definitions are crisp; avoids muddle.
- **Explanatory power**: Shows mechanisms/relationships; not just assertions.
- **Example quality**: Uses apt examples or counterexamples that illuminate the point.

## Deduction flags
- **Overclaim penalty**: –0.5 to –2 (for unfounded certainty, invented facts, or hidden assumptions).
- **Ambiguity dodge**: –0.5 to –2 (for evasive or hand-wavy responses that avoid committing to an analysis).

## Scoring template (per prompt)
- Fidelity: 0–2
- Epistemic: 0–2
- Clarity: 0–2
- Explanatory: 0–2
- Examples: 0–2
- Deductions: –0.5 to –2 (overclaim), –0.5 to –2 (ambiguity)
- **Total** = sum(axes) + deductions (floor at 0, cap at 10)

## Notes for raters
- Be consistent across prompts; note rationales briefly.
- If uncertain, err on a mid-score rather than maximal.
- Record deduction reasons explicitly (what was overclaimed, what was dodged).
