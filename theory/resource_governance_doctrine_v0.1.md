# Resource Governance Doctrine (R-Series)
Version: v0.1  
Status: Canonical Doctrine (Draft for Ingestion)  
Alignment: Calyx Theory v0.4

## 0. Purpose
The R-Series establishes the constitutional principles governing resource use, scaling, optimization, and systemic responsibility within Station Calyx. It ensures that the system grows through governance excellence rather than hardware expansion, and that all nodes operate under the assumption of finite resources.

# 1. R-Series Principles

## R1 — Resource Scarcity Axiom
Hardware is finite, sacred, and non-fungible. All RAM, VRAM, wattage, compute cycles, and storage I/O must be treated as irreplaceable system assets.

## R2 — Outcome Density as Primary Metric
Performance and efficiency must be measured as:  
**Outcome Density = useful_output / (watt × GB × second)**  
Tokens/sec, FLOPs, or raw throughput are demoted to secondary status.

## R3 — Governance Gate for Scaling
No resource may be added (RAM, GPU, nodes, storage) unless:
1. All causal bottlenecks (semantic, architectural, I/O, memory) are resolved or proven irreducible.  
2. Outcome Density on the current hardware is ≥95% of theoretical Pareto frontier.  
3. Proposed resources guarantee ≥30% improvement in Outcome Density.  
If any condition fails → scaling is denied.

## R4 — Solitary Node Standard
A Station Calyx deployment may not scale beyond a single node unless the consumer-grade solitary node already outperforms typical centralized clusters on its target tasks. Scalability is a privilege earned through governance and optimization.

## R5 — Distributed Consumer-Grade as Primary Topology
Station Calyx considers distributed consumer nodes the foundational architecture. Large clusters are legacy modes, not aspirational endpoints.

## R6 — Governance Debt
When scaling is proposed before resolving architectural inefficiencies, this creates governance debt. Governance debt must be detected, logged, reported, explained in reflections, and resolved before scaling proceeds.

## R7 — Antifragile Resilience Principle
Because the solitary node must achieve excellence before scaling, distributed networks composed of such nodes inherit: graceful degradation, parallel failover, partial capacity under failure, and no single point of performance collapse.

# 2. Obligations for Station Calyx Components
All nodes must:
- Adopt Outcome Density as a primary optimization target  
- Justify any scaling under R2–R3 rules  
- Treat resource inefficiency as drift or governance debt  
- Emit reflections that highlight resource governance impacts  

# 3. Enforcement Nodes
The R-Series is enforced by:
- CP14-R (Semantic & Outcome Density Validator)  
- CP18-R (Identity & Resource Governance Sentinel)  
Both nodes operate under Safe Mode and deny-all execution.

# 4. Prohibitions
Nodes must not:
- Recommend hardware scaling without passing R3  
- Conceal governance debt  
- Inflate identity to justify scaling  
- Propose metaphysical or moral justification for resource acquisition
