# Calyx Theory — UCC Information-Theoretic Refinement (v0.1)

**Purpose and Position**  
The Universal Configurator Cycle (UCC) is a descriptive, configuration–resolution lens for systems that move from multiple viable states into a committed state. It is not a universal law or metaphysical claim.

**Scope (Applicability)**  
UCC applies only when a system: (1) maintains a state space with multiple viable configurations; (2) undergoes a resolution event that reduces this space; (3) commits to a functionally distinct state. Examples: decision-making systems, adaptive regulation, information-processing agents, measurement-like processes resolving uncertainty. Not applicable to fully deterministic systems with no internal alternatives, purely kinematic/orbital dynamics, or reversible processes lacking fixation.

**Information-Theoretic Reframing**  
State set S has higher entropy H(S); committed state C has lower entropy H(C). UCC transition is S → C with ΔH = H(C) − H(S) < 0 under explicit boundary conditions. Entropy measure is domain-appropriate (Shannon, von Neumann, variational/free-energy formulations).

**Minimal Formal Definition**  
Given state space S, committed subset C, and entropy H(·): UCC is satisfied when H(S) > H(C); S → C is non-reversible on the operative timescale; reduction is attributable to information gain, constraints, or boundary interaction. This is descriptive/comparative, not causal.

**Predictive Aspirations and Limits**  
UCC alone is not predictive. When paired with mechanisms, hypotheses may include latency vs. entropy gradients, premature commitment vs. suboptimal constraints, or failure to commit vs. insufficient information gain. Without mechanisms, UCC remains a proto-model.

**Observer Dependence and Boundary Discipline**  
State spaces are defined, not discovered; entropy is representation-relative. Calyx requires explicit boundary declaration, justification of “viable” configurations, and documentation of entropy metrics to mitigate observer bias.

**Relationship to Existing Frameworks**  
UCC reframes symmetry breaking/attractor dynamics, epigenetic landscapes, Bayesian/drift–diffusion models, and free-energy/active inference. It is organizational clarity, not theoretical supremacy.

**Role Within Station Calyx**  
Use as: (1) diagnostic lens for agent commitment points; (2) governance tool for auditing decision resolution; (3) safeguard against premature or unjustified collapse. Supports bounded autonomy, traceability, and human primacy by making commitment events explicit and reviewable.

**Summary Statement**  
UCC describes how systems capable of representing alternatives resolve uncertainty into commitment. Grounded in information theory and governed by explicit boundaries, it provides explanatory compression without overclaiming universality; it is a lens, not a law.
