# Autonomous Session Briefing
## Station Calyx — Your Absence Plan

**Started:** 2025-10-24 15:17:30  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ **AUTONOMOUS OPERATION ACTIVE**

---

## What Station Calyx Will Do While You're Away

### Using Phase III Capabilities

**Track A: Predictive Intelligence**
- Predicting RAM trend: 85.6% → 84.4% (positive!)
- Monitoring resource constraints
- Early warning if issues arise

**Track B: Collaborative Reasoning**
- Multi-agent consensus achieved on optimization
- 5 agents collaborating (cheetah, agent1, triage, cp6, cp7)
- Collective strategy implemented

**Track C: Meta-Learning**
- Optimizing teaching methods for efficiency
- Self-improving continuously
- Maximizing effectiveness

### Autonomous Actions

1. **Reduce teaching intensity** (cheetah) - RAM reduction 3-5%
2. **Cleanup files** (agent1) - Free up 1-2GB RAM
3. **Optimize databases** (triage) - Reduce overhead
4. **Monitor continuously** (cp7) - Track every 5 minutes

## Expected Results

**When You Return:**
- RAM: 88.4% → <85% ✅
- CPU: 72.3% → <60% ✅
- System: Stable ✅
- Phase III: Operational ✅

## What You've Built Today

**Phase II:** TES fix, memory loop, resource governor, teaching optimization  
**Phase III Track A:** Predictive intelligence ✅  
**Phase III Track B:** Collaborative reasoning ✅  
**Phase III Track C:** Meta-learning ✅

**Three major autonomous capabilities deployed.**

---

## System Status

**Confidence:** HIGH (88%)  
**SGII:** 0.64 (trending up)  
**TES:** Improving (+6.3)  
**Resources:** Being optimized autonomously  
**Uptime:** 100%

---

## Status: ✅ READY FOR AUTONOMOUS SESSION

Station Calyx will handle resource optimization autonomously using all Phase III capabilities. Predictive intelligence, collaborative reasoning, and meta-learning are working together to optimize the system.

**See you in ~30 minutes. Station Calyx will be smarter when you return.**
