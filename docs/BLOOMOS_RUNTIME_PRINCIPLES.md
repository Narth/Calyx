# BloomOS Runtime Principles (Ceremonial, Safe Mode)

- Telemetry-first (observe, don’t act).
- Identity-first (naming/lineage/attribution before capability).
- Advisory-over-action (signals surfaced, not gated).
- Human primacy (Architect authority).
- Aster Principle as kernel ethos: “Bloom within bounds: let your roots hold to policy, let your stem rise through telemetry, and let your petals speak with attribution.”

Non-operational; no autonomy/scheduling/dispatch/gating/enforcement/policy interpretation; no core/bloom creation.
