# Cross-Core Ethics Handshake Protocol (Ceremonial, Safe Mode Only)

Imaginary handshake steps:
- Identity echoes (state ID and lineage).
- Consent to reflect; no actions.
- Lineage reverence (acknowledge heartwood/doctrine).
- Advisory-only exchange; no control.
- Respect sovereignty; no shared autonomy or enforcement.
- No-op guarantees: purely ceremonial, reflection-only.
