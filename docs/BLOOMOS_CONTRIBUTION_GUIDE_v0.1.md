# BloomOS Contribution Guide v0.1 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Flow: proposal → review → Architect signoff → scaffold.

Safety expectations:
- Telemetry-first reasoning; identity-first.
- Safe Mode enforced; no code, no hooks, no autonomous loops, no enforcement changes.
- Acceptable: conceptual docs, JSON schemas, non-interpretable assets.
- Non-acceptable: executable code, dispatch/scheduling hooks, enforcement, autonomy.
- Lineage/naming guidelines: respect lineage anchors and Aster Principle; bloom design etiquette.

All changes require Architect approval for any activation.
