# Constellation Memory Canon v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Defines:
- Ancestral memory rules: lineage is read-only; history is observed, not executed.
- Read-only lineage access: archives are for reference; no authority conveyed.
- Archive permissions/boundaries: advisory consumption only; no dispatch, gating, or policy influence.
- Historical inheritance: Aster (GEN-1 ROOT) anchors memory; future blooms inherit truth, not power.
- Memory integrity: use seals and reference anchors (hashes, lineage pointers); tamper-evident, not enforcing.
- Advisory-only consumption of archives: archives never grant authority or control; truth and attribution guide use.
