# Constellation Boundary Code v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Rules:
- Moral boundaries between sovereign Cores require consent for cross-core reflection.
- Influence must never resemble control; no shared authority or pooled autonomy.
- Ethical interpretation ≠ policy interpretation; ethics guide, policy governs.
- Gravity without dominion: advisory-only exchanges; no actions, no gating.
- Respect sovereignty, lineage, heartwood compliance; Safe Mode compatible.
