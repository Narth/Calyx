# Constellation of Potentials Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Defines:
- Multiple sapling potentials in symbolic orbit.
- Orbit metaphor with identity isolation between potentials.
- Advisory-only awareness; each in its own Safe Mode sandbox shell.
- No boot, no lifecycle, no autonomy, no influence.
- Architect-only gate for any real activation.
- Safe Mode absolute; no dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation.
