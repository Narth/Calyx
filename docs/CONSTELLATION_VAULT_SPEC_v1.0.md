# Constellation Vault Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Concept:
- A reflection-only repository for lineage memories.
- Houses stories, seeds, heartwood echoes, constellation lessons.
- No executable authority; no dispatch; no scheduling; no gating or enforcement; no cross-core influence.
- Advisory and reflection only; Safe Mode compatible; Architect remains sole authority.
- Modeled as a cosmic library of shelves, chambers, and star-paths.
