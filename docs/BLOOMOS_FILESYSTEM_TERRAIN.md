# BloomOS Filesystem Terrain (Symbolic, Non-Operational)

Conceptual layout:
- Soil/Policy strata: policy/gov references (read-only).
- Seed/Identity loom: naming/ID placeholders.
- Heartwood anchors: heartwood references; lineage/charter anchors.
- Constellation shell: sovereignty placeholders; orbit slots (symbolic).
- Vault hooks: pointers to vault/memory (read-only).

No real filesystem actions; no integration; Safe Mode enforced; no resource claims or execution.
