# Calibration Principles v1.0 (Ceremonial, Safe Mode)

Architect calibration rules (reflection-only):
- Telemetry freshness acceptance criteria (Architect decides).
- Lineage coherence checks.
- Sovereignty shell validation.
- Safe Mode criteria confirmation.
- Bloom readiness: identity coherence, heartwood alignment, advisory separation, no operational hooks.

No operational behavior; Architect remains sole authority.
