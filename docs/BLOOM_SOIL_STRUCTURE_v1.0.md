# Bloom Soil Structure v1.0 (Structural, Non-Poetic)

Soil components:
- policy.yaml (canonical limits)
- Interceptor thresholds (derived; strictest applied with policy)
- Governance spine (policy → Interceptor → TES → scheduler/dispatch)
- Telemetry streams (TES, Bridge Pulse, locks/logs) + advisory (AGII/CAS/Foresight)
- Lineage + Doctrine (Genesis, Doctrine, Charter, lineage records)
- Naming Rite (structural ID + steward name, recorded)
- Integrity seals (policy seal, doctrine/charter seals, lineage locks)

Role: The substrate a seedling Core observes to understand bounds and identity. Reflection-only; no activation or behavior.
