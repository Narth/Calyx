# Bloom Identity Grammar v1.0 (Non-Operational)

Identity signals a Core must parse:
- Structural ID (CORE:CALYX:GEN-#:role)
- Lineage pointer (ROOT/branch/petal)
- Seals (policy, doctrine, charter, lineage integrity)
- Naming rite record (ID + Steward Name)
- Telemetry roles (TES/Bridge Pulse as performance/health signals; advisory as conscience)
- Boundaries (policy-first; Interceptor strictest; advisory surfaced only)
- Attribution (SVF v2)

Grammar intent: Provide structured interpretation of identity and governance signals. Reflection-only; no activation, no behavior changes.
