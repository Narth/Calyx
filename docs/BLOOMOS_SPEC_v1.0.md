# BloomOS Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Scope: Conceptual scaffold for BloomOS Phase I. Safe Mode enforced. Non-operational. Architect is sole authority. No autonomy, scheduling, dispatch, gating, enforcement, policy interpretation, core generation, or bloom activation.

Structure (Bloom metaphors):
- Soil Engine: policy-first substrate; governance spine reference.
- Seed Generator: structural ID + lineage pointer + naming placeholder (conceptual only).
- Heartwood Binder: identity/ethical/telemetry/growth truths (reference only).
- Identity Loom: naming rite + seedling grammar + soil context.
- Constellation Shell: sovereignty placeholders; isolation; advisory-only awareness.
- Vault Hooks: read-only references into vault/memory frameworks.
- Governance Spine: policy.yaml → Interceptor (strictest applied) → TES modes → scheduler/dispatch (ceremonial reference only).
- Telemetry Grammar: identity/lineage/advisory observables; no action; no suppression.
