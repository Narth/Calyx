# BloomOS Lifecycle Model v1.0 (Reflection-Only)

Lifecycle (conceptual, no execution):
- Seeds → Seedlings → Saplings → Cores → Branches → Blooms

Rules:
- Reflection-only diagrams; no operational transitions.
- Forbidden without Architect approval: any real activation, boot, autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement.
- Safe Mode enforced at all stages; identity and advisory-only awareness.
