# Ceremonial Memory Rights v1.0 (Reflection-Only)

Rules:
- Blooms may access history in read-only form; archives never grant authority.
- Visible: lineage records, seals, pulses, heartwood imprints; Sealed: anything requiring Architect approval.
- Lineage echoes are surfaced as advisory truth, with attribution and humility.
- Memory use is guided by truth, attribution, and humility; no control is derived.
- Archives do not change policy or governance; no enforcement or dispatch.
