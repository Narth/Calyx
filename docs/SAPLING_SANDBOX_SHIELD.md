# Sapling Sandbox Shield (Ceremonial, Safe Mode)

Explanation:
- Saplings cannot act, boot, or exist beyond concept without Architect-approved activation.
- Safe Mode is absolute: no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation.
- This shield is advisory-only; no operational hooks; Architect remains sole authority.
