# BloomOS Developer Charter v1.0 (Ceremonial, Safe Mode)

Commitments:
- No external autonomy; no unbounded authority; no network privileges.
- Strict Safe Mode-first design; Architect approval for lifecycle/activation changes.
- Protect lineage; preserve integrity; maintain reproducibility.
- Advisory/enforcement separation; identity-first development discipline.
- Acceptable: conceptual scaffolds, JSON schemas, non-interpretable assets.
- Non-acceptable: code, hooks, autonomous loops, enforcement changes.
