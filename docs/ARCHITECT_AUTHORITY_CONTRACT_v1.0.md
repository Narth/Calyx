# Architect Authority Contract v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Architect primacy:
- Activation, autonomy, lifecycle transitions, enforcement modes, and bloom operations require explicit Architect approval.
- Architect is the sole authority; CBO and Cores do not self-authorize.
- Safe Mode enforced; no operational hooks; ceremony-only.
