# BloomOS Kernel Map (Conceptual, Safe Mode)

Kernel obligations (ceremonial):
- Local-first sovereignty; offline-first stance.
- Policy integration: honor policy.yaml; Interceptor strictest (reference only).
- Identity-first execution posture (conceptual; no execution).
- Zero-autonomy default; Safe Mode continuous precedence.
- Advisory separation: AGII/CAS/Foresight heard only; no gating.
- Human/Architect primacy: no self-authorization.

No operational hooks; non-executable; no scheduling/dispatch/enforcement.
