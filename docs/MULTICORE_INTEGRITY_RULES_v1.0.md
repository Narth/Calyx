# Multi-Core Integrity Rules v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Integrity maintenance:
- Doctrine/lineage/heartwood canonical checks per Core; no enforcement.
- Advisory provenance across cores is recorded, not acted upon.
- Hash-chain stitching is read-only; no operational syncing; no dispatch between cores.
- No shared authority; only shared truth via documented hashes and seals.
- Safe Mode compatible; policy-first; Architect primacy.
