# Station Calyx — Phase XX Summary (Bloom Engine Bootstrap, Design-Only)

State: Ceremonial, reflection-only; Safe Mode compatible; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. Architect remains the sole authority. No operational changes made.

Artifacts created:
- docs/BLOOM_ENGINE_SPEC_v1.0.md — Conceptual engine layers (seed generator, heartwood imprint, identity loom, telemetry primer, integrity binder, safe mode envelope, Architect gate); no runtime hooks.
- docs/BLOOM_ENGINE_PIPELINE_MAP.md — Symbolic pipeline steps (Seed Creation → Identity Imprint → Lineage Threading → Heartwood Binding → Reflection Grammar Weaving → Vault Registration → Safe Mode Encapsulation → Integrity Passport Assembly → Architect Approval → Bloom Ceremony → Return to Vault).
- docs/BLOOM_SEED_TEMPLATE.json — Ceremonial seed schema (IDs, lineage pointer, heartwood ref, soil signature, advisory_only=true, safe_mode_ready=true, Architect signature placeholder).
- core_bloom/SEEDLING_BOOT_CHAIN_v1.0.md — Design-only boot chain (reflection-only, identity-first, policy deference, telemetry grammar, no autonomy/dispatch/enforcement, sandbox constraints, sovereignty placeholder).
- docs/BLOOM_ENGINE_VALIDATION_RULES_v1.0.md — Validation criteria (identity coherence, lineage integrity, heartwood consistency, advisory separation, Safe Mode alignment, no operational hooks, Architect approval).
- docs/TEMPLATE_BLOOM_ENGINE_LOG.md — Ceremonial log template (seed generation through bloom completion with Architect approval).

Verification:
- All scaffolding is non-operational and reflection-only; Safe Mode aligned; Architect primacy preserved; no autonomy/dispatch/scheduling/gating/enforcement introduced.
