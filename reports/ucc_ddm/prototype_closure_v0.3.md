# UCC×DDM Prototype Closure (v0.3)

The Universal Configurator Cycle (UCC), reframed as an entropy-based diagnostic overlay, has been validated in a minimal two-choice drift–diffusion model under bounded, noisy conditions.

With a frozen design, empirical calibration, and multiple noise regimes (Wiener and OU), UCC diagnostics reliably surface two classes of anomalies that standard RT-only baselines miss by construction:

- Failure-to-commit, detected via sustained entropy plateaus post-median RT.
- Premature collapse, detected via empirically calibrated early entropy-slope thresholds.

These diagnostics are stable across parameter grids, invariant to belief-mapping choice, and do not alter underlying system dynamics.

The prototype is considered complete and successful. Further extensions (multi-choice DDMs, agent systems) are optional and out of scope for this validation cycle.
