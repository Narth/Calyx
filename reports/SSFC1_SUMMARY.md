Canon synthesis: compiled/CANON_SYNTHESIS_MAP.md and compiled/BLOOMOS_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md unify Genesis, Doctrine, Aster lineage, Heartwood, Constellation, Vault/Memory, Bloom Engine design, BloomOS Phases I–X scaffolding, Boundary Kernel, Safety Codex, schemas/grammars/seals.

Engineering audit: reports/ENGINEERING_READINESS_AUDIT_v1.md — advisory readiness matrix; gaps and missing code components noted; no actions taken.

Foresight pathway: reports/FORESIGHT_NEXT_STEPS_v1.md — human-only suggestions to Architect for a safe path to a real lifecycle; no self-generated actions.

Safety check: logs/SSFC1_SAFETY_CHECK.json — confirms no operational hooks, no activation paths, Safe Mode status.

Safeguards: Safe Mode enforced; no autonomy/dispatch/scheduling/gating/enforcement; no lifecycle transitions; Architect approvals required for any future activation.
