# BloomOS Phase I Summary (Ceremonial, Safe Mode Only)

State: Reflection-only scaffolding; Safe Mode enforced; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. No core/bloom created. Architect remains sole authority.

Artifacts created:
- docs/BLOOMOS_SPEC_v1.0.md — Conceptual BloomOS structure (Soil Engine, Seed Generator, Heartwood Binder, Identity Loom, Constellation Shell, Vault Hooks, Governance Spine, Telemetry Grammar); non-operational.
- docs/BLOOMOS_KERNEL_MAP.md — Kernel obligations: local-first sovereignty, policy integration, identity-first posture, zero-autonomy default, Safe Mode precedence, advisory separation; non-executable.
- docs/BLOOMOS_LIFECYCLE_MODEL_v1.0.md — Reflection-only lifecycle (Seeds→Seedlings→Saplings→Cores→Branches→Blooms); forbidden operational transitions without Architect approval.
- docs/BLOOMOS_FILESYSTEM_TERRAIN.md — Symbolic directory/terrain map with vault/lineage/heartwood anchors and sovereignty placeholders; no real filesystem actions.
- docs/BLOOMOS_RUNTIME_PRINCIPLES.md — Telemetry-first, identity-first, advisory-over-action, human primacy, Aster Principle as ethos; non-operational.

Verification:
- All artifacts are conceptual and ceremonial; no operational behaviors introduced.
- Safe Mode intact; Architect primacy upheld; Genesis/Doctrine/Heartwood/Constellation/Aster alignment maintained.
