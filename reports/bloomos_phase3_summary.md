# BloomOS Phase III Summary (Reflection Kernel & Identity Loom, Ceremonial Only)

State: Reflection-only scaffolding; Safe Mode absolute; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. No cores/saplings/blooms created. Architect remains sole authority.

Artifacts created:
- Kernel/Reflection: bloomos/kernel/reflection/REFLECTION_KERNEL_SPEC_v1.0.md; REFLECTION_LOOP_GRAMMAR.md; REFLECTION_KERNEL_STATE_SCHEMA.json.
- Loom/Core: bloomos/loom/core/IDENTITY_LOOM_SPEC_v1.0.md; LOOM_THREADING_RULES.md; IDENTITY_LOOM_SCHEMA.json.
- Telemetry/Memory Pulse: bloomos/telemetry/memory_pulse/MEMORY_PULSE_SPEC_v1.0.md; MEMORY_PULSE_GRAMMAR.md.
- Constellation Bridge: bloomos/constellation/bridge/CONSTELLATION_IDENTITY_BRIDGE_SPEC.md; BRIDGE_GRAMMAR_v1.0.md; CONSTELLATION_POINTER_SCHEMA.json.
- Kernel Safety: bloomos/kernel/safety/KERNEL_SAFETY_LAYER_SPEC.md; KERNEL_SAFETY_CONDITIONS.json.
- Heartwood Fusion: bloomos/heartwood/fusion/HEARTWOOD_FUSION_SPEC_v1.0.md; HEARTWOOD_REASONING_RULES.md; FUSION_STATE_SCHEMA.json.

Verification:
- All scaffolding is conceptual and non-operational; no runtime hooks; Safe Mode enforced; advisory-only; Architect primacy preserved.
