## 5. Key Observations

### TES Performance:
- **Current:** 55.0 (20-sample rolling mean)
- **Peak:** 94.5 (2025-10-23)
- **Decline:** Steady drop from 94.5 → 72.7 → 55.0 over 48 hours
- **Action:** Multiple optimization tasks dispatched to cp8-mentor and cp9-tuner

### Resource Management:
- CPU and RAM slightly above comfort thresholds but within operational limits
- GPU utilization low (14%), indicating potential compute capacity available
- Disk space is a concern (22.97% free)

### Operational Status:
- Bridge Overseer pulse cycle operational
- Recent dispatch activity focused on TES improvement
- No active objectives in queue
- System in stable monitoring mode

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Monitor TES recovery** - Track whether recent optimization tasks improve TES scores
2. **Review disk space** - Investigate disk usage and consider cleanup if needed
3. **CPU/RAM monitoring** - Observe if elevated usage is transient or requires intervention

### Strategic Actions:
1. **Review optimization task outcomes** - Assess effectiveness of TES improvement initiatives
2. **Consider resource allocation** - GPU utilization suggests capacity for additional compute workload
3. **TES analysis** - Investigate root cause of TES decline from peak performance

## 7. Bridge Overseer Health

**CBO Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL  
**Heartbeat:** Active (last: 2025-10-26T01:41:23Z)  
**Pulse Interval:** 4 minutes (240 seconds)  
**Last Pulse:** 2025-10-26T00:29:16  
**Objectives Pending:** 0  
**Tasks Active:** 0  
**Dispatch Rate:** All recent tasks dispatched successfully  

---

## Summary

Bridge Overseer is maintaining stable operations in monitoring mode. The system processed multiple batches of TES optimization objectives over the past 24 hours, with all tasks successfully dispatched to designated agents (cp8-mentor, cp9-tuner, sys-integrator). TES has stabilized at 55.0 after a decline from peak performance. System resources are slightly elevated but within operational bounds. No immediate interventions required; continuing to monitor progress of dispatched optimization tasks.

**Confidence:** Medium-High (system operational, some metrics below optimal targets)  
**Action:** Continue monitoring; reassess after TES optimization tasks complete
