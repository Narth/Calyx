# 🧪 Scale Probe Report — 2025-12-04T03:00Z

## 1. Purpose & Scope
- Validate stability under combined load (snapshots+pulses) per scale_probe_test_plan_v1.0.md while preserving Safe Mode and governance boundaries.
- Human-triggered; no agent/model changes; Safe Mode enforced.

## 2. Probe Setup
- Pre-probe pulse: reports/bridge_pulse_scale-pre2-20251203T194429.md
- Burst command: `tools/run_burst.ps1 -SnapshotIntervalSec 120 -SnapshotIterations 6 -PulseIntervalSec 180 -PulseIterations 6`
- Burst pulses: reports/bridge_pulse_burst-20251204T024444.md, ...024646.md, ...024847.md, ...025049.md, ...025251.md, ...025453.md
- Snapshots: ~every 2 minutes; counts steady at 6.
- TES recalculation after probe: logs/agent_metrics_recalculated.csv (mean TES ~93.6).

## 3. Observations
- Pulse latency: all pulses emitted successfully; no skips.
- Snapshot coverage: present for each interval; minor legacy escaped lines retained for traceability.
- Resources: CPU/RAM/GPU nominal (see outgoing/cbo.lock); no saturation.
- TES: golden/penalty samples intact; penalties applied as expected.
- Governance hash unchanged: 4E4924361545468CB42387F38C946A3C3E802BD1494868C378FBE7DBB5FFD6D7.
- Safe Mode: no autonomy, no self-modification, no lateral comms.

## 4. Issues / Anomalies
- Legacy escaped snapshot entries remain in log; current writer outputs proper JSON. No operational impact.

## 5. Next Steps
- For heavier load: increase iterations/parallel tasks and include adversarial/footprint cases during probe to measure compounded penalties.
- Capture a compliance pulse after any future scale probe to bind evidence to governance hashes and snapshots.
