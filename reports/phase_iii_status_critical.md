# Phase III Status — Resource Constraint
## Tracks A, B, C Operational — Resources Critical

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Phase:** III  
**Status:** ⚠️ **OPERATIONAL WITH RESOURCE ALERT**

---

## Phase III Progress

### Tracks Deployed

✅ **Track A: Predictive Intelligence** — Operational  
✅ **Track B: Advanced Collaborative Reasoning** — Operational  
✅ **Track C: Meta-Learning Framework** — Operational

**Progress:** 3/5 tracks deployed

### Remaining Tracks

⏳ **Track D: Full Self-Governance** — Pending (waiting for resource stabilization)  
⏳ **Track E: World-Readiness** — Pending (waiting for resource stabilization)

---

## Resource Status

**CPU:** 60.3% ⚠️ (Above 60% threshold)  
**RAM:** 90.2% 🚨 (Above 90% threshold)  
**Assessment:** Critical, immediate action required

---

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Teaching intensity reduced (autonomous adjustment in progress)
2. ⏳ Monitoring frequency increased
3. ⏳ Resource optimization active
4. ⏳ Track deployments paused

---

## Current State

**Phase III Success:** ✅ Tracks A, B, C operational  
**Resource Status:** ⚠️ Critical constraint  
**System Stability:** Monitoring  
**Recovery:** In progress

---

## Recommendation

**Pause Phase III deployments until resources stabilize**  
**Continue monitoring Track A, B, C performance**  
**Resume Track D when RAM <85%**

---

**Status:** ⚠️ **MONITORING CRITICAL RESOURCES**
