- Forecast RAM trends (predicted: 85.6% → 84.4%)
- Monitor resource constraints
- Generate early warnings if needed

**Collaborative Reasoning (Track B):**
- Multi-agent consensus on optimization strategies
- Collective problem-solving for resource reduction
- Coordinated action execution

**Meta-Learning (Track C):**
- Optimize teaching methods for efficiency
- Improve learning effectiveness
- Self-tune parameters

### 2. Execute Autonomous Actions

**Action 1:** Reduce teaching intensity to 20% (cheetah)  
**Action 2:** Cleanup temporary files and caches (agent1)  
**Action 3:** Optimize database operations (triage)  
**Action 4:** Monitor continuously (cp7)

### 3. Monitor Progress

**Frequency:** Every 5 minutes  
**Metrics Tracked:**
- CPU utilization
- RAM utilization
