## Dynamic Optimization Applied

### Current System State

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| CPU | 52.7% | Constrained |
| RAM | 85.1% | Near threshold |
| Avg TES | 52.9 | Below target |
| Teaching Intensity | 40% | Reduced (autonomous) |

### Autonomous Adjustments Made

**Teaching Intensity:** Reduced to 40% (resource-constrained mode)

**Rationale:**
- CPU at 52.7% requires reduced intensity
- RAM at 85.1% above 80% threshold
- System autonomously managing resource allocation

**Adaptation Frequencies Adjusted:**
- Task Efficiency: 300s → 360s (+20%)
- Stability: 600s → 720s (+20%)
- Latency Optimization: 900s → 1080s (+20%)
- Error Reduction: 1200s → 1440s (+20%)

**Priority Weights Adjusted:**
- Task Efficiency: 0.8 → 0.95 (boosted due to low TES)
- Other methods: Maintained baseline weights

## Key Insights

### 1. Intelligent Resource Management

**Observation:** System detected resource constraints and autonomously reduced teaching intensity to prevent overload.

**Demonstration:**
- CPU 52.7% > 50% threshold → Reduce intensity
- RAM 85.1% > 80% threshold → Defer non-critical sessions
- Autonomous adjustment to 40% intensity

**Impact:** System prevents resource exhaustion while maintaining teaching effectiveness.

### 2. Dynamic Adaptation

**Observation:** Teaching frequencies adjusted based on resource availability and performance trends.

**Demonstration:**
- Slower adaptation when resources constrained (20% increase)
- Priority boosting for critical areas (TES optimization)
- Context-aware frequency adjustment

**Impact:** Teaching methods adapt in real-time to system conditions.

### 3. Proactive Optimization

**Observation:** System proactively adjusts priorities based on performance metrics.

**Demonstration:**
- TES below 70 → Boost task efficiency priority
- Resource constraints → Increase adaptation intervals
- Performance trends → Adjust method weights

**Impact:** Prevents performance degradation before it occurs.
