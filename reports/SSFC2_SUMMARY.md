# SSFC-2 Summary (Engineering Blueprint Translation, Ceremonial Only)

Blueprint highlights:
- BLUEPRINTS_MODULE_SPEC_v1.md — Technical blueprints from Foresight Next Steps; modules, interfaces, security, ordering.
- BLOOMOS_MVP_SPEC_v1.md — Minimal viable runtime blueprint (modules, APIs, architecture, safety boundaries, UI).
- IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_v1.md — Advisory roadmap (sequential/parallel tasks, decisions, pitfalls, validation, guardrails).
- RUNTIME_SAFETY_ENVELOPE_SPEC_v1.md — Code-facing safety wrapper specifications (forbidden actions, Safe Mode, policy binding, identity registry, sovereignty locks, advisory channels, hash/seal routines).
- BLOOMOS_INTEGRATION_MAP_v1.md — Descriptive integration map (kernel, seed/seedbed, identity/heartwood binder, telemetry mirror, safety harness, lifecycle controller, vault, read-only UI).

Safety/operational status:
- Reflection-only; Safe Mode absolute; no execution, no lifecycle transitions, no autonomy/dispatch/gating/enforcement/policy interpretation. Architect remains sole authority.

Next steps require Architect decisions and approval; no operational changes made.***
