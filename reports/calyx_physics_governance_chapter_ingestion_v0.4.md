# Calyx Physics §3 Governance Chapter (v0.4) — Ingestion Summary

Classification: Calyx Physics §3 Governance Expansion (Quiet Maintain). No behavioral changes applied.

## Section Highlights
- **§3.0 Purpose**: Governance ensures capability follows consent; autonomy never exceeds understanding; Architect remains final arbiter.
- **§3.1 Transparency**: Preconditions for influence—introspection, trace logging, respect_frame, causality/evidence; transparency is mandatory.
- **§3.2 Governance Over Execution**: No autonomous runs/scheduling/mandate edits/privilege escalations/timing changes without governed gates (Architect or governed execution layer).
- **§3.3 Overseer Transparency**: Heartbeat, provenance/intent, causal chains, sample/evidence counts; no hidden activity.
- **§3.4 Agent Transparency**: Declare mandate, expose state, log decisions, honor Laws 2/4/5/9/10; no invisible behavior.
- **§3.5 Planner/Scheduler Sprout**: Propose only (no execute/trigger/schedule); expose options/tradeoffs/objectives/constraints/impact; lifecycle: Shadow Sprout → Supervised Sprout → optional Bloom (approval-required).
- **§3.6 Stability & Retention**: Append-only logs; logged rotation/compaction; reproducible archives; no silent deletion; Architect oversight.
- **§3.7 Night Cycle Doctrine (new)**: Bounded, low-risk passive maintenance when Architect away (integrity checks, schema validation, consistency scans, report generation). Forbidden: scheduling, planners, config changes, mandates, privilege changes. All activity logged with ts, cycle_id, checks, anomalies, corrections, evidence, respect_frame="night_cycle_doctrine".
- **§3.8 Autonomy Floor/Ceiling**: Floor—validators/inspectors/report generators may act within mandate; Ceiling—planners/schedulers require explicit approval; gap cannot narrow without Architect consent.
- **§3.9 Architect Primacy**: Intentionality, clarity, explicit consent anchor all laws; no agent/plan/doctrine supersedes Architect authority.

## Notes
- Ingestion only; no scheduling, no planner activation, no autonomy changes. Night Cycle execution remains subject to explicit approval and must respect doctrine constraints.
