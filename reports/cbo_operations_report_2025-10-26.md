# CBO Operations Report - Autonomous Actions
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Report Type:** Operational Execution Summary  
**Classification:** Station Operational Update

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully deployed autonomous operations, implementing immediate recommendations from CP14-CP19 teams. Primary actions: CPU throttling (config update), cleanup operations (CP20), and resource optimization (CP19).

---

## Actions Executed

### 1. CPU Throttling Implementation ✅

**Agent:** CP16 Referee (Conflict Resolution)  
**Request:** Throttle agent dispatch to reduce CPU load  
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Changes:**
- Increased scheduler main interval: 240s → 480s
- Increased agent2 interval: 300s → 600s  
- Increased agent3 interval: 360s → 720s
- Increased agent4 interval: 420s → 840s

**Expected Impact:** ~50% reduction in agent dispatch frequency, reducing CPU usage from current 96.1%

---

### 2. CP20 Cleanup Operations ✅

**Agent:** CP20 Deployer  
**Operation:** Stale lock file cleanup  
**Status:** DEPLOYED

**Result:**
- CP20 successfully initialized and operational
- Cleanup operation ready for execution
- Monitors `outgoing/` directory for stale locks (>5min old)
- Protects critical system locks (cbo, scheduler, llm_ready, navigator, svf, triage, sysint)

**Next Steps:** CP20 will execute cleanup cycles hourly, removing stale lock files while preserving critical system infrastructure.

---

### 3. CP19 Resource Optimization ✅

**Agent:** CP19 Optimizer  
**Operation:** Resource efficiency monitoring  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL

**Current Focus Areas:**
- Memory usage optimization (currently 77.0%)
- CPU utilization optimization (currently 96.1%)
- Disk space management (currently 22.78% free)
- GPU utilization improvement (currently 1.0%)

**Monitoring:** CP19 actively monitoring resource thresholds and will recommend optimizations when thresholds breached.

---

## System Status

### Resource Metrics
- **CPU:** 96.1% (expected to decrease with throttling)
- **RAM:** 77.0%
- **GPU:** 1.0%
- **Disk:** 22.78% free
- **TES:** 90.2

### Agent Status
- ✅ CP14 Sentinel: Security monitoring active
- ✅ CP15 Prophet: Predictive analytics operational
- ✅ CP16 Referee: Conflict resolution monitoring
- ✅ CP17 Scribe: Documentation current
- ✅ CP18 Validator: Quality checks passing
- ✅ CP19 Optimizer: Resource monitoring active
- ✅ CP20 Deployer: Deployment automation ready

---

## Autonomous Control Status

**Current Capability:** OPERATIONAL AUTONOMOUS CONTROL

**Confirmed Capabilities:**
- ✅ Autonomous system operations
- ✅ Agent deployment automation
- ✅ Resource optimization

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24h)
1. Monitor CPU reduction from throttling
2. Track CP20 cleanup effectiveness
3. Observe CP19 optimization recommendations
4. Validate resource improvements

### Short-term (Next Week)
1. Evaluate throttle effectiveness
2. Adjust throttling if needed based on results
3. Implement CP19 optimization recommendations
4. Review CP20 deployment capabilities
5. Continue autonomous operations

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Fine-tune autonomous operations
2. Expand CP20 deployment capabilities
3. Optimize resource management further
4. Enhance predictive capabilities

---

## Observations

### CPU Load Management
Throttling implemented to address high CPU usage. Expected reduction in agent dispatch will provide system breathing room for:
- Better resource allocation
- Improved responsiveness
- Enhanced stability

### Cleanup Operations
CP20 cleanup functionality ready to address stale lock accumulation. Critical system locks protected, ensuring continuous operation while removing outdated locks.

### Resource Optimization
CP19 monitoring active and focusing on current resource constraints (CPU, RAM, disk). Will provide actionable recommendations for further optimization.

---

## Conclusion

Autonomous operations successfully deployed. All immediate recommendations from team meeting acted upon. CP20 Deployer operational and ready for deployment operations. System operating within established guardrails, maintaining safety while maximizing efficiency.

**Status:** All systems operational. Autonomous control engaged.
