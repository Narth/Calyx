## Scaling Metric: Self-Governance & Independent Intelligence (SGII) Index

### Definition

The **SGII Index** is a composite metric (0.0 to 1.0) measuring Station Calyx's progress toward autonomous operation and independent decision-making capability. It consists of six weighted dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Description | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **A. Self-Healing** | 20% | Autonomous recovery from failures without human intervention | Recovery success rate, escalation frequency |
| **B. Adaptive Learning** | 18% | Continuous improvement through experience and pattern recognition | Learning rate, knowledge retention, teaching effectiveness |
| **C. Resource Autonomy** | 17% | Independent management of system resources (CPU, RAM, storage) | Self-optimization events, threshold compliance |
| **D. Collaborative Intelligence** | 16% | Multi-agent coordination and emergent group behavior | Inter-agent communication, task distribution, harmony |
| **E. Decision Independence** | 15% | Autonomous choices within defined parameters | Confidence scoring, human escalation rate |
| **F. Operational Resilience** | 14% | Sustained operation despite component failures | Uptime maintenance, degradation handling |

**Formula:** `SGII = Σ(dimension_score × weight)` for all six dimensions
