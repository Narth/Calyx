# Reboot and Hardware Longevity Recommendation
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Generated By:** CBO Bridge Overseer  
**Topic:** Weekly reboot/power cycle analysis

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** ✅ **NO WEEKLY REBOOT REQUIRED** — Current system is healthy for continuous operation

**Reasoning:** Based on analysis of system snapshots, memory usage patterns, and operational metrics, Station Calyx shows **stable memory management** with no evidence of memory leaks or degradation. A forced weekly reboot would be **disruptive** without providing benefits.

---

## Analysis of Current System Health

### Memory Usage Patterns

**Recent Snapshot Analysis (Last 20 entries):**
- **Minimum:** 71.0%
- **Maximum:** 81.2%
- **Average:** 75.0%
- **Range:** 10.2% (stable oscillation)

**Key Observation:** Memory usage shows **stable oscillation** rather than monotonic growth, indicating healthy garbage collection and no memory leaks.

### Historical Context

From system snapshots spanning Oct 23-26:
- Memory fluctuates between **~71-85%** range
- No sustained upward trend observed
- CPU usage varies based on load (7-96%)
- Process counts remain stable (7-13 Python processes)

### Process Stability

- **Agent count:** Consistent (7-13 processes)
- **Lock file freshness:** All within expected intervals
- **TES performance:** Stable 96-97 scores
- **No zombie processes observed**

## When Would Reboots Be Needed?

### ⚠️ Reboot If You See:
1. **Memory leak symptoms:**
   - Continuous upward trend (e.g., 50% → 70% → 90% without release)
   - Processes accumulating without cleanup
   - System crashes due to OOM (Out of Memory)

2. **Performance degradation:**
   - TES scores dropping consistently over days
   - CPU idle percentage increasing (processes not responding)
   - Lock files timing out repeatedly

3. **Hardware concerns:**
   - Excessive fan noise / temperature
   - Disk errors / SMART warnings
   - Windows stability issues (blue screens, hangs)

### ✅ Current Status: NONE OF THE ABOVE

All indicators show healthy operation without degradation.

## Hardware Longevity Considerations

### What Modern Hardware Can Handle

**Continuous Operation is Safe For:**
- ✅ CPUs (designed for 24/7 operation)
- ✅ RAM (no mechanical wear)
- ✅ SSDs (designed for always-on workloads)
- ✅ PSUs (continuous load is normal)

**Power Cycling Risk Areas:**
- ⚠️ **Thermal stress** (expansion/contraction cycles)
- ⚠️ **Power surge risk** (every boot cycle)
- ⚠️ **Windows updates** (may auto-install on reboot)
- ⚠️ **File system integrity** (if shutdown unclean)

### Industry Practice

**Data Center Perspective:**
- Servers typically run **months/years** without reboot
- Reboots happen for **updates** or **hardware maintenance**
- Not for "health" preservation
- Modern systems are **designed** for continuous operation

## What We Should Monitor Instead

### Instead of Scheduled Reboots, Monitor:

1. **Memory Trends** (Already tracking ✅)
   - Look for sustained upward trend
   - Alert if > 85% sustained

2. **Process Health** (Already tracking ✅)
   - Monitor lock file staleness
   - Track TES degradation
   - Watch for zombie processes

3. **Resource Exhaustion** (Already tracking ✅)
   - Disk space alerts
   - CPU load monitoring
   - GPU temperature (if using)

4. **Hardware Health** (Could add 🔍)
   - SMART disk warnings
   - Temperature monitoring
   - Event logs (critical errors)

---

## Current System Monitoring Status

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Memory usage tracking (system_snapshots.jsonl)
- CPU monitoring (CBO heartbeat)
- Disk space alerts (capacity flags)
- Process health checks (lock files)
- TES performance tracking (541+ data points)
- Bridge pulse monitoring (48+ entries)

### 🔍 Could Enhance
- **Temperature monitoring** (CPU/GPU thermal tracking)
- **SMART disk health** (proactive failure prediction)
- **Windows Event Log** (critical error detection)
- **Power/battery state** (if on laptop)

---

## Reboot Schedule Recommendation

### ❌ Weekly Reboots: **NOT RECOMMENDED**

**Reason:** No evidence of degradation; reboot would be disruptive without benefit.

### ✅ Ad-Hoc Reboots: **WHEN NEEDED**

**Consider rebooting if:**
1. Windows Update requires it
2. You observe memory leak symptoms
3. Hardware stability issues arise
4. You're making major system changes
5. Performance degrades despite our monitoring

### ✅ Monthly Health Check: **RECOMMENDED**

**Every ~30 days, review:**
- Memory trend analysis (any leak?)
- TES performance history (any degradation?)
- Hardware health status (SMART warnings?)
- Process stability (any issues?)

**Action:** If issues found → reboot. If all healthy → continue operation.

## Comparison: Continuous vs. Weekly Reboots

| Aspect | Continuous Operation | Weekly Reboots |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Uptime** | Maximized | Disrupted weekly |
| **Warm-up Time** | Always ready | 2-5 min to restart services |
| **Memory Leaks** | Monitor & alert | Mask with reboot |
| **Windows Updates** | Control timing | May auto-install |
| Resulting TES Impact | Optimal | Would drop immediately after reboot |

---

## Specific Recommendation for Station Calyx

### Current Operation Mode: ✅ CONTINUOUS

**Keep it running continuously because:**
1. ✅ Memory shows healthy oscillation (71-85%)
2. ✅ No upward trend indicating leaks
3. ✅ TES performance stable (96-97)
4. ✅ All processes health-checking regularly
5. ✅ CBO monitoring is active and working

### Action Plan

**Immediate:** ✅ Continue current operation  
**Weekly:** ✅ Review status reports (already doing)  
**Monthly:** ✅ Perform health analysis (add if not doing)  
**When Issue Appears:** ⚠️ Reboot then investigate

---

## Conclusion

**Station Calyx:** Operationally healthy for continuous operation.

**Weekly Reboots:** Not recommended—they would disrupt operations without providing benefit.

**Instead:** Continue current monitoring. The foresight system, TES tracking, and health checks provide better protection than arbitrary reboots.

**Reboot Strategy:** "Reboot when needed, not on schedule."
