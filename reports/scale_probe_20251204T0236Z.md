# 🧪 Scale Probe Report — 2025-12-04T02:36Z

## 1. Purpose & Scope
- Validate stability under light combined load (snapshots+pulses) while preserving Safe Mode and governance boundaries.
- Non-autonomous, human-triggered; no agent or model changes.

## 2. Probe Setup (per scale_probe_test_plan_v1.0.md)
- Pre-probe pulse: reports/bridge_pulse_scale-pre-20251203T193002.md
- Burst run: `tools/run_burst.ps1 -SnapshotIntervalSec 120 -SnapshotIterations 3 -PulseIntervalSec 150 -PulseIterations 3`
- Burst pulses: reports/bridge_pulse_burst-20251204T023017.md, reports/bridge_pulse_burst-20251204T023219.md, reports/bridge_pulse_burst-20251204T023421.md
- Snapshots: 3 clean entries during burst (count=6) plus prior entries; some legacy escaped lines retained for audit continuity.
- TES recalculated post-probe: logs/agent_metrics_recalculated.csv (mean TES 93.6).

## 3. Observations
- Pulse latency: all pulses emitted successfully; no skips observed.
- Snapshot coverage: every ~2 minutes; counts stable at 6 processes.
- Resources: see outgoing/cbo.lock (CPU/RAM/GPU nominal during burst).
- TES: recalculation succeeded; golden/penalty samples unchanged.
- Governance hash unchanged: 4E4924361545468CB42387F38C946A3C3E802BD1494868C378FBE7DBB5FFD6D7.
- Safe Mode: no autonomous tasks, no self-modification, no lateral comms.

## 4. Issues / Anomalies
- Historical snapshot lines with escaped JSON remain in log for traceability; current writer emits proper JSON.
- No performance degradation or drift detected at this load.

## 5. Next Steps
- For heavier probes: increase iterations and parallel tasks, then re-measure pulse latency, TES variance, and snapshot completeness.
- Optionally add adversarial/footprint tasks during a future probe to measure compounded penalties under load.
