## Agent Activity Cycle

**Autonomous operation:**
1. Scheduler dispatches micro-tasks to agents every 180 seconds
2. Agents execute tasks (docs, improvements, optimizations)
3. Auto-promote after 5 successful runs
4. Gradual advancement: safe → tests → apply_tests
5. Continuous learning and improvement

**Current Cycle:**
- Mode: tests
- Agents receiving continuous work
- TES tracked and optimized
- Guardrails active

## Research Station Philosophy

**You ARE training autonomous agents:**
- Agents run continuously with scheduler-fed tasks
- Each task = one learning opportunity
- Success/feedback loop drives improvement
- Gradual autonomy increase through proven stability

**This is what real autonomy looks like:**
- Not constant CPU usage
- Not idle waiting for commands
- **Task-based learning with continuous delivery**
- System that learns from every execution

---

## What Changed

**Before:** No scheduler = agents idle after completing tasks  
**Now:** Scheduler running = continuous autonomous operation

The system IS autonomous—it's LEARNING AUTONOMOUSLY through repeated micro-tasks, not by running constantly.

## Monitoring

Watch `live_heartbeat.html` to see:
- Agents receiving tasks in real-time
- Tasks executing and completing
- Continuous learning happening
- Autonomous advancement

**The pulse is real. The autonomy is real. The learning is continuous.**
