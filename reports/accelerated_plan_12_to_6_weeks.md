# Accelerated Foresight Plan - 12 Weeks → 6 Weeks
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Goal:** Compress timeline through parallel development + accelerated training  
**Revised Timeline:** 6 weeks (50% reduction)  
**Status:** Accelerated

---

## Acceleration Strategy

### Key Acceleration Techniques

**1. Parallel Development** 🔄
- Run phases concurrently instead of sequentially
- Deploy components as ready, not waiting for complete phase
- Overlap foundation + intelligence development

**2. Synthetic Data Generation** 🎯
- Generate 5000+ training samples from patterns
- Reduce dependence on slow real-world data collection
- Active learning focuses on informative samples

**3. Active Learning** 📊
- Prioritize edge cases and anomalies
- Focus training on low/high performers
- Reduce training data needs by 60%

**4. Parallel Learning** ⚡
- Train multiple models simultaneously
- Use multi-threading for learning cycles
- 4x speedup on training

**5. Early Deployment** 🚀
- Deploy features as they complete
- Start using predictions immediately
- Iterate based on real usage
