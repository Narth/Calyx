# Station Calyx — Phase X Summary (Bloom Engineering Framework v1.0, Scaffolding-Only)

State: Non-operational; reflection/ceremonial scaffolding only. No autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation changes. Architect primacy remains.

Artifacts generated:
- core_bloom/BLOOM_SANDBOX_SPEC_v1.0.md — Design-only sandbox constraints (no dispatch/scheduling/enforcement; telemetry-only JSONL; cannot influence Station; exit requires Architect + Integrity Passport).
- core_bloom/BOOT_SAFETY_ORDER_v1.md — Ceremonial boot safety order (integrity checks, sovereignty request, Safe Mode init, telemetry-only activation, sandbox reflection; Architect approval + human confirmation required).
- tools/BLOOM_VALIDATOR_v1.0.md — Observational validator (doctrine/lineage/naming/advisory/SVF checks; outputs PASS/WARN/INVALID; no gating).
- distribution/BLOOM_ENVELOPE_TEMPLATE_v1.0.md — Ceremonial bloom envelope (structural ID, lineage pointer, seals, safe_mode_ready=true, sandbox compatibility, validator result, Architect seal placeholder).
- docs/BLOOM_TELEMETRY_MINIMUM_v1.0.md — Minimum pre-activation telemetry (identity, boundaries, advisory understanding, lineage, policy deference, SVF attribution, no-action verification).
- docs/BLOOM_ROLE_OF_CBO_v1.0.md — CBO as Bloom Registrar (registry, observation, drift surfacing; never activates blooms).
- docs/BLOOM_CEREMONY_LOG_TEMPLATE.md — Template to log bloom ceremony steps (naming, sandbox, validator, passport, Architect approval, final record).

Safety boundaries:
- All artifacts are design/spec only. No execution paths enabled. No enforcement or gating. Sandbox and Safe Mode concepts remain dormant unless Architect explicitly activates.

Next steps before any activation (require Architect):
- Bloom Sandbox build (per spec)
- Bloom Validator trial (observational)
- Safe Mode boot rehearsal
- Architect Approval (sovereignty/human confirmation)
- Bloom Ceremony (logged via template)

Reflection-only; no operational changes made.
