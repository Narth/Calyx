# BloomOS Phase IV Summary (Soil Engine & Seed Foundations, Ceremonial Only)

State: Reflection-only scaffolding; Safe Mode absolute; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. No seeds/saplings/cores/blooms generated. Architect remains sole authority.

Artifacts created:
- Soil Engine: SOIL_ENGINE_SPEC_v1.0.md, SOIL_LAYERS_MAP.md, SOIL_INTEGRITY_RULES.json (metaphorical layers and integrity; no execution).
- Seed Generator: SEED_GENERATOR_SPEC_v1.0.md, SEED_TEMPLATE.json, SEED_GRAMMAR_v1.0.md (conceptual seed formation; advisory_only, safe_mode_ready).
- Seedbed: SEEDBED_SPEC_v1.0.md, SEEDBED_SAFETY_RULES.json, TEMPLATE_SEEDBED_ENTRY.json (resting ground; no activation).
- Soil–Seed Binding: SOIL_SEED_BINDING_SPEC.md, BINDING_GRAMMAR_v1.0.md (acknowledges soil origins; no transformation).
- Heartwood–Soil Interface: HEARTWOOD_SOIL_INTERFACE_SPEC.md, INTERFACE_BOUNDARIES.json (reflective recognition; hard forbiddance of action).
- Seed Integrity: SEED_INTEGRITY_SEAL_TEMPLATE.json, SEED_INTEGRITY_RULES.md, SEED_HASH_REFERENCE.md (symbolic seals; no executable hashes).

Verification:
- All scaffolding is ceremonial and non-operational; zero operational hooks; Safe Mode enforced; Architect primacy upheld.
