- CPU: 72.3% → 62.3% (10% reduction)
- Improvement: HIGH

**Predicted Timeline:**
- 5 minutes: Initial impact
- 15 minutes: Noticeable improvement
- 30 minutes: Target reached

---

## Monitoring Plan

**Frequency:** Every 5 minutes  
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Alert Thresholds:**
- RAM >90%: CRITICAL alert
- CPU >70%: WARNING alert

**Metrics Tracked:**

- RAM utilization
- Available memory
- Process breakdown
- Teaching intensity
- System stability

---

## Success Criteria

**Must Achieve:**
- RAM <85% sustained
- CPU <60% sustained
- 100% uptime maintained
- System stability maintained

**Nice to Have:**
- RAM <80%
- CPU <50%
- Performance improvement
- Efficiency gains

---

## Autonomous Decision Authority

**Granted Authority:**
- Adjust teaching intensity autonomously
- Cleanup files and caches
- Optimize database operations
- Defer non-critical tasks
- Scale back operations if needed

**Constraints:**
