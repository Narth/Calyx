# Resource Management & Service Health Report
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Generated by:** CBO Bridge Overseer

## Executive Summary

Applied recommended resource management and service health improvements. Key findings and actions documented below.

## Resource Analysis

### Python Process Inventory
- **Total Processes:** 75 Python processes detected
- **Total Memory Usage:** ~435 MB across all processes
- **Average per Process:** ~5.8 MB per process
- **Session Classification:** All processes running under SYSTEM (Session Name: Services)

### Process Classification
The vast majority of Python processes (74 of 75) are:
- Running as Windows Services
- Have no accessible command line (empty cmdline)
- Protected by SYSTEM privileges
- Cannot be terminated without administrator elevation

### Legitimate Services Identified
Only **1 clear legitimate process** identified:
- `agent_scheduler.py` (PID 54568) - Primary agent coordination service

## Actions Taken

### ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Process Audit**
   - Identified 75 Python processes
   - Analyzed memory usage patterns
   - Classified processes by session type

2. **Memory Analysis**
   - Total Python memory: 435 MB
   - Individual process footprint: 5-16 MB (very light)
   - Most processes are SYSTEM services

3. **Service Health Monitoring**
   - Verified agent_scheduler is operational
   - Confirmed last activity timestamp (11:36 UTC)
   - Reviewed memory limit thresholds (70% soft limit)

4. **Bridge Pulse Updated**
   - Added new pulse entry at 13:18 UTC
   - Documented current system state
   - CPU: 17.4%, RAM Available: 5,333 MB

### ⚠️ Limitation Encountered

**SYSTEM-Protected Processes:** Cannot kill the 74 zombie processes without administrator privileges. These processes:
- Are running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
- Likely part of Windows service infrastructure
- Consume minimal memory individually (~5 MB each)
- May be related to Python's multiprocessing or Windows service framework

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor Memory Usage:** Current RAM is at 70% threshold - agent launches are being throttled
2. **Investigate Zombie Processes:** These SYSTEM processes may need investigation if they persist
3. **Continue Bridge Pulse:** Monitoring active and generating regular pulse reports

### Optional Actions (Requires Admin)
If you have administrator access and want to clean up SYSTEM processes:
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.SessionName -eq 'Services'} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Service Health Status

✅ **Agent Scheduler:** Operational  
✅ **Bridge Pulse:** Active  
✅ **Resource Monitoring:** Functional  
⚠️ **Memory Limits:** At soft threshold (70%)

## Conclusion

System is operational with proper monitoring in place. The 75 Python processes are mostly SYSTEM-protected services that cannot be cleaned up without administrator privileges. Core services (agent_scheduler) are functioning correctly. Memory limits are being respected, preventing excessive resource consumption.

**Status:** Ready for Station Calyx CLI testing
