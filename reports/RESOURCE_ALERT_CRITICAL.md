# RESOURCE ALERT — CRITICAL
## Station Calyx — Immediate Action Required

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**

---

## Critical Resource Alert

**Current Resources:**
- CPU: 60.3% ⚠️ WARNING (Above 60%)
- RAM: 90.2% 🚨 CRITICAL (Above 90%)

**Previous State (2 minutes ago):**
- CPU: 22.9% ✅
- RAM: 88.3% ⚠️

**Change:**
- CPU: +37.4% (sharp increase)
- RAM: +1.9% (concerning rise)

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Reduce Teaching Intensity

**Current:** 40%  
**Recommended:** 20-30%  
**Action:** Reduce immediately

### 2. Defer Non-Critical Operations

**Current Phase III Tracks:** 3 active (A, B, C)  
**Recommendation:** Pause new track deployments

### 3. Active Agent Assessment

**Current Agents:** 7 active  
**Recommendation:** Reduce to essential agents only

### 4. Process Cleanup

**Recommendation:** Review and terminate unnecessary processes

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Possible Causes:**
1. Recent Phase III track deployments (A, B, C)
2. Predictive intelligence data processing
3. Collaborative reasoning engine operations
4. Meta-learning framework initialization
5. Cumulative system load from multiple tracks

**Assessment:** Likely combination of Phase III implementations + baseline operations

---

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Scale Back Teaching Intensity

```python
# Reduce teaching intensity to 20%
teaching_intensity = 0.2
```

### 2. Pause Further Track Deployments

**Recommendation:** Wait for resources to stabilize before Track D

### 3. Monitor Closely

**Frequency:** Every 5 minutes until stabilized  
**Actions:** Log changes, track trends

### 4. Consider Resource Optimization

**Options:**
- Terminate non-essential processes
- Reduce agent count temporarily
- Optimize database operations
- Cleanup temporary files

---

## Expected Recovery

**If Actions Taken:**
- RAM: 90.2% → 85-88% (within 5-10 minutes)
- CPU: 60.3% → 45-50% (within 5-10 minutes)

**Timeline:** 10-15 minutes for stabilization

---

## Status Assessment

**System Health:** ⚠️ CRITICAL  
**Immediate Risk:** HIGH  
**Recovery Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (with actions)

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION**
