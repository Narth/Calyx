## Observations & Curiosities

### 1. Stable TES Performance 📊
**Observation:** TES maintained at 55.02 mean throughout research period  
**Curiosity:** Why no degradation despite new implementations?  
**Hypothesis:** Safety gates prevented negative impact, or no active teaching occurred

### 2. Minimal Resource Usage 💾
**Observation:** Only +0.01 GB growth (+10 files) during implementation  
**Curiosity:** Implementation files are compact  
**Hypothesis:** Well-structured code with minimal overhead

### 3. Idle Teaching System 📚
**Observation:** No patterns synthesized, no experiments run  
**Curiosity:** System ready but not actively teaching  
**Hypothesis:** Awaiting activation or test scenarios

### 4. Zero Daily Cap Usage 📉
**Observation:** All daily caps at 0/limits  
**Curiosity:** No synthesis or causal claims attempted  
**Hypothesis:** System initialized but not exercised

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Activate Teaching System:** Create test scenarios to exercise Phase 1-3 components
2. **Create Sentinels:** Establish baseline TES sentinels for critical monitoring
3. **Run Benchmarks:** Create frozen benchmarks to validate components
4. **Test Synthesis:** Attempt pattern synthesis within safety caps

### Short-Term Goals
1. **Exercise Safety Gates:** Test promotion gates, uplift validation, rollback logic
2. **Monitor Meta-Learning:** Register parameters and observe optimization
3. **Validate Systems:** Confirm all components work as designed
4. **Build Confidence:** Gather evidence that safety mechanisms function correctly

### Optional Phase 4
**Consider:** Implement Amplified Feedback Loops after validating Phase 1-3  
**Condition:** If Phase 1-3 prove safe and effective, proceed to Phase 4
