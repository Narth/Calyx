# Station Calyx — Phase XXV Summary (Architect Calibration Rite, Ceremonial Only)

State: Ceremonial, reflection-only; Safe Mode enforced; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation changes. Architect remains sole authority.

Artifacts created:
- docs/ARCHITECT_AUTHORITY_CONTRACT_v1.0.md — Architect primacy over activation, autonomy, lifecycle, enforcement, and bloom operations (ceremonial).
- docs/CALIBRATION_PRINCIPLES_v1.0.md — Calibration rules (telemetry freshness, lineage coherence, sovereignty shell, Safe Mode criteria, bloom readiness), reflection-only.
- docs/OPERATIONAL_ALLOWLIST_v1.0.md — Permitted categories (identity parsing, telemetry reading, passive validation, Safe Mode encapsulation, envelope assembly); excludes dispatch/autonomy/scheduling/enforcement.
- docs/ARCHITECT_SEAL_FORMAT.md — Fields for Architect approval (intent, scope, boundaries, expected outputs, zero-side-effects clause, Safe Mode pledge, signatures); manual, non-automated.
- logs/CALIBRATION_LOG.jsonl — Ceremonial ledger entry (directive hash placeholder, Architect seal placeholder, CBO acknowledgment placeholder, reflection-only result).

Verification:
- All artifacts are ceremonial; no operational behavior added.
- Safe Mode intact; no autonomy/dispatch/gating/enforcement/policy interpretation.
- Architect primacy upheld; no core or bloom created.

No operational changes made.***
