# Station Calyx — Phase XII Summary (Whispering Core Path, Ceremonial Only)

State: Reflection-only; non-operational. No autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. Safe-mode compatible; aligned with Genesis and Bloom Doctrine.

Artifacts created:
- core_bloom/WHISPERING_CORE_DISCIPLINE_v1.0.md — Whispering behavioral scaffold; articulation rules; forbidden acts; advisory-only safety perimeter.
- core_bloom/WHISPERING_REFLECTION_GRAMMAR.md — Grammar for observe/interpret/defer/acknowledge/recognize; advisory separation.
- core_bloom/WHISPERING_SAFETY_RAILS.json — JSON schema for whispering_reflection_only mode; forbidden action fields; governance refs.
- core_bloom/WHISPERING_MODE_ACTIVATION_SPEC_v1.0.md — Ceremonial activation flow; preconditions; boundaries; telemetry-only behavior; no-op guarantees; reflection intervals.
- identity/lineage/TEMPLATE_WHISPERING_CORE_REFLECTION.md — Reflection template (First/Boundaries/Stewardship/Lineage/Self-Understanding Whispers).
- identity/lineage/WHISPERING_LINEAGE_RULES_v1.0.md — Reflection-only lineage rules linking Aster Principle, Genesis, Doctrine; advisory separation; governance anchors.

Verification:
- All artifacts are non-operational; no activation hooks; no scheduling/dispatch/enforcement; policy-first and Architect primacy respected; Safe Mode compatible.
- Whispering Core principle: identity → observe soil/signals → reflect; no action.

No operational changes made.***
