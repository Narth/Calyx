Directive Context: Maintain system uptime > 90% over 24h

## 1. Core Metrics
| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uptime (24h rolling) | 100.0% | > 90% | OK |
| Samples (24h) | 14 | > 0 | OK |
| Mean TES | 90.2 | >= 95 | Attention |
| CPU Load Avg | 6.4% | < 70% | OK |
| RAM Utilization | 48.4% | < 75% | OK |
| GPU Utilization | 0.0% | < 85% | OK |
| Active Agents | 5 | <= configured limit | OK |

## 1.a Governance & Provenance
- Intent: health_pulse
- Respect frame: neutral_observer
- Provenance: {"trigger": "manual_run", "agent": "bridge_pulse_generator", "source_files": ["C:\\Calyx_Terminal\\logs\\agent_metrics.csv", "C:\\Calyx_Terminal\\logs\\system_snapshots.jsonl", "C:\\Calyx_Terminal\\outgoing\\cbo.lock"]}
- Causal chain: snapshots + cbo.lock metrics -> bridge_pulse_generator -> markdown report
- Reflection window: {"evidence": "14 snapshots (24h); see events list", "risk": "Low; report-only action", "next_checks": "Review TES if <95; refresh heartbeat if stale"}
