# BloomOS Phase X Summary (Safety & Recap Initiative, Ceremonial Only)

State: Reflection-only; Safe Mode absolute; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. No seeds/saplings/cores/blooms created. Architect (Jorge) remains sole authority.

Artifacts created (under bloomos/phase10_safety/):
- BLOOMOS_SAFETY_CODEX_v1.0.md — Safety philosophy, human-first boundaries, Safe Mode, Architect primacy, policy.yaml as canonical, Interceptor strictest (referenced only).
- BLOOMOS_EXTERNAL_SAFETY_BRIEF.md — One-page external brief on identity-first, advisory-only safety; human oversight model.
- BLOOMOS_REGULATOR_SENTENCE.md — Single-sentence safety statement.
- BLOOMOS_INTERNAL_RECAP_v1.0.md — Phase I–IX recap, spines, boundaries, Safe Mode shells.
- BLOOMOS_SAFETY_ENVELOPE_SCHEMA.json — Safety envelope schema (identity_lock, heartwood_ref, safe_mode=true, advisory_only=true, hashes, Architect signature placeholder).
- BLOOMOS_SAFETY_DASHBOARD_SPEC.md — Read-only dashboard spec for safety indicators.
- THE_PATH_SO_FAR.md — Chronicle of the conceptual system; zero operational behavior.

Verification:
- All scaffolding is ceremonial and non-operational; Safe Mode enforced; no operational hooks introduced; Architect primacy upheld.
