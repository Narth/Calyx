## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** MEDIUM

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 49.1, +7.7% over 11.3h)

**Rationale:** Based on 36 data points over 11.3 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.2590/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 49.1
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 49.7
- Slope: 0.259/hour

- `snapshot:2026-01-07T09:22:10`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 36 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 3: advisory_intent:storage_pressure

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 5.3 hours

Intent 'storage_pressure' generated 3 advisories (avg 1.3 notes) over 5.3h

**Rationale:** The 'storage_pressure' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 3 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T01:18:17`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T03:36:36`

### Pattern 4: cooccurrence:cpu_percent+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 2
**Time Span:** 5 hours

Metrics 'cpu_percent' and 'memory_percent' trend together (2 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 2 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-06T22`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T00`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T01`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

### Pattern 5: cooccurrence:disk_percent_used+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 5 hours

Metrics 'disk_percent_used' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.
