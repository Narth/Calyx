# System Assessment

*Generated: 2026-01-07 16:13 UTC*

> This assessment describes observed system behavior.
> It does not recommend actions or predict outcomes.

## Environment Summary

This system is primarily storage-constrained. Currently: storage is constrained (89% used).

## Recent Behavior

Over the observation window (60 minutes, 4 samples): Resource usage showed variability in CPU. Some resource variability was observed, which may indicate active workloads or system processes.

## Resource Trajectories

**Storage:** Storage has been relatively consistent. Currently at 88.6%, which is constrained. If current patterns continue, current levels are expected to persist. (Evidence strength: strong)

**Memory:** Memory has been gradually decreasing (down ~10%). Currently at 42.5%, which is stable. If current patterns continue, usage may continue to decrease. (Evidence strength: strong)

**Compute:** Compute has been showing variability. Currently at 2.7%, which is stable. If current patterns continue, variability may persist. (Evidence strength: strong)

## Observation Summary

Observation readiness: High. Based on 60 snapshots over 17.5 hours. Primary constraints: storage-constrained. Areas to be mindful of: compute stability, storage capacity. Overall confidence in this assessment: moderate.
