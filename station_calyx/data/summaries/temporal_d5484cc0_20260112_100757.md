## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** HIGH

cpu_percent is volatile (2.3 -> 2.4, +4.3% over 127.1h)

**Rationale:** Based on 280 data points over 127.1 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope -0.0012/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 2.3
- Last: 2.4
- Min: 0.0
- Max: 18.7
- Slope: -0.0012/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T02:52:23`
- `snapshot:2026-01-12T10:00:27`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 280 samples only

## Drift Warnings

### Warning 1: disk_percent_used

**Direction:** decreasing
**Confidence:** HIGH

disk_percent_used is decreasing (88.6 -> 80.6, -9.0% over 127.1h)

**Rationale:** Based on 280 data points over 127.1 hours, disk_percent_used shows a decreasing trend with slope -0.0737/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T02:52:23`
- `snapshot:2026-01-12T10:00:27`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 280 samples only

## Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: advisory_intent:stability_first

**Confidence:** HIGH
**Data Points:** 24
**Time Span:** 124.3 hours

Intent 'stability_first' generated 24 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 124.3h

**Rationale:** The 'stability_first' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 24 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T02:52:25`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T03:11:43`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T03:28:59`
- `advisory:2026-01-09T22:05:22`
- `advisory:2026-01-10T01:05:46`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 2: advisory_intent:storage_pressure

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
**Data Points:** 9
**Time Span:** 66.2 hours

Intent 'storage_pressure' generated 9 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 66.2h

**Rationale:** The 'storage_pressure' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 9 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T03:36:36`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T06:36:54`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T09:37:11`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T12:37:29`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T15:33:41`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 3: cooccurrence:cpu_percent+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 18 hours

Metrics 'cpu_percent' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T02`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T03`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T09`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

---

### Pattern 4: trend_repeat:cpu_percent

**Confidence:** HIGH
**Data Points:** 23
**Time Span:** 122.1 hours

'cpu_percent' has shown 'volatile' trend 23 times over 122.1h

**Rationale:** The metric 'cpu_percent' repeatedly shows a 'volatile' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-07T02:00:21`
- `trend:2026-01-07T02:52:27`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:11:45`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:28:59`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:36:36`

**Uncertainties:**
- Repeated detection may reflect analysis frequency
- Underlying cause requires investigation

---

### Pattern 5: trend_repeat:memory_percent

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
**Data Points:** 5
**Time Span:** 6.7 hours

'memory_percent' has shown 'increasing' trend 5 times over 6.7h

**Rationale:** The metric 'memory_percent' repeatedly shows a 'increasing' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-07T02:52:27`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:11:45`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:28:59`
- `trend:2026-01-07T03:36:36`
- `trend:2026-01-07T09:36:40`

**Uncertainties:**
- Repeated detection may reflect analysis frequency
- Underlying cause requires investigation
