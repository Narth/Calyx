## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 47.2, +3.5% over 0.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 4 data points over 0.7 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 2.0921/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 47.2
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 47.2
- Slope: 2.0921/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:49:19`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 4 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 2: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** LOW

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 7.0, -5.4% over 0.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 4 data points over 0.7 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope 2.9008/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 7.0
- Min: 2.0
- Max: 7.4

- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:49:19`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 4 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence
