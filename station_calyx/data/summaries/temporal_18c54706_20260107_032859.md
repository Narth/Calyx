## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 49.7, +9.0% over 5.4h)

**Rationale:** Based on 12 data points over 5.4 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.7426/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 49.7
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 49.7
- Slope: 0.7426/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T03:28:57`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 12 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 2: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** LOW

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 6.2, -16.2% over 5.4h)

**Rationale:** Based on 12 data points over 5.4 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope -0.1896/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 6.2
- Min: 0.4
- Max: 17.1

- `snapshot:2026-01-07T03:28:57`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 12 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

## Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: advisory_intent:stability_first

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 6
**Time Span:** 5.1 hours

Intent 'stability_first' generated 6 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 5.1h

**Rationale:** The 'stability_first' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 6 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-06T22:22:24`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T01:44:08`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T02:00:19`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T02:52:25`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T03:11:43`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 2: advisory_intent:resource_constrained

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 2.4 hours

Intent 'resource_constrained' generated 3 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 2.4h

**Rationale:** The 'resource_constrained' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 3 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-06T22:23:04`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:47:11`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:49:02`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 3: cooccurrence:cpu_percent+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 2
**Time Span:** 5 hours

Metrics 'cpu_percent' and 'memory_percent' trend together (2 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 2 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-06T22`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T00`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T01`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

---

### Pattern 4: cooccurrence:disk_percent_used+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 5 hours

Metrics 'disk_percent_used' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-06T22`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T00`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T01`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

---

### Pattern 5: trend_repeat:memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 8
**Time Span:** 4.4 hours

'memory_percent' has shown 'increasing' trend 8 times over 4.4h

**Rationale:** The metric 'memory_percent' repeatedly shows a 'increasing' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-06T22:49:30`
- `trend:2026-01-06T22:50:19`
- `trend:2026-01-07T00:48:03`
- `trend:2026-01-07T00:49:24`
- `trend:2026-01-07T01:44:11`

**Uncertainties:**
- Repeated detection may reflect analysis frequency
- Underlying cause requires investigation

---

### Pattern 6: trend_repeat:cpu_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 8
**Time Span:** 4.4 hours

'cpu_percent' has shown 'volatile' trend 8 times over 4.4h

**Rationale:** The metric 'cpu_percent' repeatedly shows a 'volatile' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-06T22:49:30`
- `trend:2026-01-06T22:50:19`

### Pattern 7: trend_repeat:disk_percent_used

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 4
**Time Span:** 1.2 hours

'disk_percent_used' has shown 'increasing' trend 4 times over 1.2h

**Rationale:** The metric 'disk_percent_used' repeatedly shows a 'increasing' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-07T00:48:03`
- `trend:2026-01-07T00:49:24`
- `trend:2026-01-07T01:44:11`
- `trend:2026-01-07T02:00:21`
