## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: disk_percent_used

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

disk_percent_used is increasing (88.5 -> 88.6, +0.1% over 3.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 9 data points over 3.9 hours, disk_percent_used shows a increasing trend with slope 0.0311/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 88.5
- Last: 88.6
- Min: 88.5
- Max: 88.6
- Slope: 0.0311/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T02:00:17`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 9 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 2: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 49.6, +8.8% over 3.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 9 data points over 3.9 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.7793/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 49.6
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 49.6
- Slope: 0.7793/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T02:00:17`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 9 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 3: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** LOW

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 4.7, -36.5% over 3.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 9 data points over 3.9 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope 0.2830/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 4.7
- Min: 0.4
- Max: 17.1
- Slope: 0.283/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T02:00:17`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 9 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

## Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: advisory_pattern

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Advisory pattern recurring: stability_first profile generating 1 note(s) appeared 3 times

**Rationale:** The same advisory pattern has appeared 3 times, suggesting a persistent condition worth investigating.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-06T22:22:24`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T01:44:08`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T02:00:19`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may be expected behavior
- Root cause requires manual investigation

---

### Pattern 2: advisory_pattern

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Advisory pattern recurring: resource_constrained profile generating 1 note(s) appeared 3 times

**Rationale:** The same advisory pattern has appeared 3 times, suggesting a persistent condition worth investigating.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-06T22:23:04`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:47:11`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:49:02`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may be expected behavior
- Root cause requires manual investigation
