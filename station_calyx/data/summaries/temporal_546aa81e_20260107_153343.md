## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** MEDIUM

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 2.7, -63.5% over 17.5h)

**Rationale:** Based on 60 data points over 17.5 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope -0.1737/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 2.7
- Min: 0.0
- Max: 17.1
- Slope: -0.1737/hour

**Evidence:**

- `snapshot:2026-01-07T15:33:37`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 60 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

**Data Points:** 6
**Time Span:** 14.3 hours

Intent 'storage_pressure' generated 6 advisories (avg 1.2 notes) over 14.3h

**Rationale:** The 'storage_pressure' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 6 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T01:18:17`

### Pattern 4: cooccurrence:cpu_percent+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 6 hours

Metrics 'cpu_percent' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-06T22`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T00`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T01`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

---

### Pattern 5: cooccurrence:disk_percent_used+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 6 hours

Metrics 'disk_percent_used' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.
