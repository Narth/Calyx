## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: disk_percent_used

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

disk_percent_used is increasing (88.5 -> 88.6, +0.1% over 2.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 5 data points over 2.7 hours, disk_percent_used shows a increasing trend with slope 0.0382/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 88.5
- Last: 88.6
- Min: 88.5
- Max: 88.6
- Slope: 0.0382/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T00:46:29`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 5 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 2: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 46.5, +2.0% over 2.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 5 data points over 2.7 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.2825/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 46.5
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 47.2
- Slope: 0.2825/hour

### Trend 3: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** LOW

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 4.3, -41.9% over 2.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 5 data points over 2.7 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope -0.0893/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 4.3
- Min: 2.0
- Max: 7.4
