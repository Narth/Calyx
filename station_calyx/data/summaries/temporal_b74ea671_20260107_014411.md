## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: disk_percent_used

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

disk_percent_used is increasing (88.5 -> 88.6, +0.1% over 3.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 8 data points over 3.7 hours, disk_percent_used shows a increasing trend with slope 0.0335/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 88.5
- Last: 88.6
- Min: 88.5
- Max: 88.6
- Slope: 0.0335/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T01:44:04`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 8 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 2: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** LOW

memory_percent is increasing (45.6 -> 48.9, +7.2% over 3.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 8 data points over 3.7 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.6700/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 45.6
- Last: 48.9
- Min: 45.6
- Max: 49.0
- Slope: 0.67/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T01:44:04`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 8 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

### Trend 3: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** LOW

cpu_percent is volatile (7.4 -> 1.9, -74.3% over 3.7h)

**Rationale:** Based on 8 data points over 3.7 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope 0.4546/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 7.4
- Last: 1.9
- Min: 0.4
- Max: 17.1
- Slope: 0.4546/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-06T22:04:49`
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T01:44:04`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 8 samples only
- Short observation window limits confidence

## Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: advisory_pattern

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Advisory pattern recurring: resource_constrained profile generating 1 note(s) appeared 3 times

**Rationale:** The same advisory pattern has appeared 3 times, suggesting a persistent condition worth investigating.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-06T22:23:04`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:47:11`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T00:49:02`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may be expected behavior
- Root cause requires manual investigation
