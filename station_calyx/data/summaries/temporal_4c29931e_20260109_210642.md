**Data Points:** 9
**Time Span:** 67.8 hours

Intent 'storage_pressure' generated 9 advisories (avg 1.1 notes) over 67.8h

**Rationale:** The 'storage_pressure' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 9 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T01:18:17`

### Pattern 4: cooccurrence:cpu_percent+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 9 hours

Metrics 'cpu_percent' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.

**Evidence:**
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-06T22`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T00`
- `trend_bucket:2026-01-07T01`

**Uncertainties:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Co-occurrence may be coincidental

---

### Pattern 5: cooccurrence:disk_percent_used+memory_percent

**Confidence:** LOW
**Data Points:** 3
**Time Span:** 9 hours

Metrics 'disk_percent_used' and 'memory_percent' trend together (3 co-occurrences)

**Rationale:** These metrics have shown correlated behavior 3 times, suggesting they may be related or share a common cause.
