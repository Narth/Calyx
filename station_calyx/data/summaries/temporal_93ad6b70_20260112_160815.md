## Trends Detected

### Trend 1: memory_percent

**Direction:** increasing
**Confidence:** HIGH

memory_percent is increasing (49.0 -> 46.0, -6.1% over 131.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 299 data points over 131.9 hours, memory_percent shows a increasing trend with slope 0.0148/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 49.0
- Last: 46.0
- Min: 31.5
- Max: 57.2
- Slope: 0.0148/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T04:06:39`
- `snapshot:2026-01-12T16:01:15`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 299 samples only

### Trend 2: cpu_percent

**Direction:** volatile
**Confidence:** HIGH

cpu_percent is volatile (1.6 -> 1.6, +0.0% over 131.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 299 data points over 131.9 hours, cpu_percent shows a volatile trend with slope -0.0010/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Values:**
- First: 1.6
- Last: 1.6
- Min: 0.0
- Max: 18.7
- Slope: -0.001/hour

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T04:06:39`
- `snapshot:2026-01-12T16:01:15`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 299 samples only

## Drift Warnings

### Warning 1: disk_percent_used

**Direction:** decreasing
**Confidence:** HIGH

disk_percent_used is decreasing (88.6 -> 80.6, -9.0% over 131.9h)

**Rationale:** Based on 299 data points over 131.9 hours, disk_percent_used shows a decreasing trend with slope -0.0681/hour. This is a statistical observation, not a prediction.

**Evidence:**
- `snapshot:2026-01-07T04:06:39`
- `snapshot:2026-01-12T16:01:15`

**Uncertainties:**
- Trend may not continue at observed rate
- External factors may affect future values
- Analysis based on 299 samples only

## Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: advisory_intent:storage_pressure

**Confidence:** MEDIUM
**Data Points:** 8
**Time Span:** 63.2 hours

Intent 'storage_pressure' generated 8 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 63.2h

**Rationale:** The 'storage_pressure' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 8 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-07T06:36:54`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T09:37:11`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T12:37:29`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T15:33:41`
- `advisory:2026-01-07T16:21:45`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 2: advisory_intent:stability_first

**Confidence:** HIGH
**Data Points:** 23
**Time Span:** 63.1 hours

Intent 'stability_first' generated 23 advisories (avg 1.0 notes) over 63.1h

**Rationale:** The 'stability_first' intent profile has been consistently active, generating advisories 23 times. This suggests ongoing monitoring of this concern.

**Evidence:**
- `advisory:2026-01-09T22:05:22`
- `advisory:2026-01-10T01:05:46`
- `advisory:2026-01-10T04:06:06`
- `advisory:2026-01-10T07:06:26`
- `advisory:2026-01-10T10:06:43`

**Uncertainties:**
- Pattern may reflect normal monitoring cadence
- Advisory frequency depends on snapshot rate

---

### Pattern 3: trend_repeat:cpu_percent

**Confidence:** HIGH
**Data Points:** 19
**Time Span:** 120.5 hours

'cpu_percent' has shown 'volatile' trend 19 times over 120.5h

**Rationale:** The metric 'cpu_percent' repeatedly shows a 'volatile' trend, indicating a persistent condition rather than a one-time event.

**Evidence:**
- `trend:2026-01-07T09:36:40`
- `trend:2026-01-07T15:33:43`
- `trend:2026-01-07T16:21:46`
- `trend:2026-01-07T22:01:18`
- `trend:2026-01-09T21:06:42`

**Uncertainties:**
- Repeated detection may reflect analysis frequency
- Underlying cause requires investigation
