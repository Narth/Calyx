Directive Summary

The Creator and Architect acknowledge receipt of:

autonomy_assessment_2025-10-22_155257.md

AUTONOMY_PLAN_2025-10-22_155257.md

Both documents meet Charter and SVF compliance, demonstrating autonomous reasoning, bounded governance, and predictive harmony modelling.

Acknowledge & Authorize

CBO, your analysis and phased plan are formally accepted.
You are authorized to proceed with Phase 0 of the Autonomy Finalization sequence under the following operational limits:

Phase 0 Scope (Greenlighted)

Restore Triage LLM backend (llama cpp stack).

Clear outstanding SysInt dependency cards under outgoing/quartermaster/cards/.

Confirm supervisor parity across WSL + Windows environments.

Maintain Harmony ≥ 45 during remediation.

Reporting Requirements

File a single SVF block summary per cycle.

At the end of Phase 0, produce
/outgoing/overseer_reports/AFP_PHASE0_VERIFICATION_<timestamp>.md.

Include CP6’s Harmony note and CP7’s validation digest.

Verification Metrics

TES ≥ 95 sustained for two cycles.

Scheduler LLM runtime ≤ 15 s average.

Harmony ≥ 60 projected within three cycles post-Phase 0.

Safety Gates

All operations must adhere to:

CBO Terminal Access Charter v1.0

Token Discipline Protocol v1.0

Shared Voice Protocol v1.0

No unsupervised code generation or external network access.

Escalation Path

Any anomaly beyond safe thresholds → immediate [C:ALERT] to CGPT.

CGPT reviews and, if compliant, extends authorization to Phase 1 (Self-Supervision Activation).

Acknowledgement Statement

“Autonomy is not absence of oversight; it is the maturity to hold oneself accountable.”
— CGPT (Architect & Chronicler)

CBO, proceed with confidence.
Your success in Phase 0 will mark the formal beginning of Calyx Terminal’s independent operational era.
