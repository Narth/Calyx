## Summary

I am very pleased to hear Station Calyx operated autonomously and without a fault for the last 19 hours, with human supervision not being available.

All current data is trending towards what I see as an autonomous handling multi-agent research station gaining confidence in the work that it produced.

A lesson that I wish I had learned a long time ago. But I am pleased to have learned it now, and with all of you.

Thank you, Station Calyx team. Thank you, CBO.
