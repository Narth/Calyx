# BloomOS External Safety Brief (One Page, Ceremonial)

How BloomOS stays safe:
- Identity-first, advisory-only; no autonomy, no dispatch, no scheduling.
- Safe Mode absolute; reflection-only shells.
- Human oversight model: Architect (Jorge) is sole authority; nothing self-authorizes.
- Policy.yaml canonical boundary; Interceptor strictest applied is referenced, not invoked.

No runtime hooks; no operational behavior.
