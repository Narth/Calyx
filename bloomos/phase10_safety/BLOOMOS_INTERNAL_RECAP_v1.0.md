# BloomOS Internal Recap v1.0 (Ceremonial)

Summary Phase I → Phase IX:
- Core spines: identity, governance (policy→Interceptor→TES ref), telemetry, ethical/heartwood, lineage, advisory separation.
- Boundaries/invariants: Safe Mode shells; advisory-only; human primacy; no runtime hooks.
- Truth sources: Genesis → Aster → Doctrine → Heartwood → Constellation → Kernel unification.
- All Safe Mode shells: sandbox, boundary kernel, sovereignty shields, forbidden-action matrices.

Reflection-only; no operational behavior; Architect primacy upheld.
