# Soil Engine Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Reflection-Only)

Symbolic soil sources: policy.yaml (canonical), Interceptor cushions (strictest applied, reference only), governance spine, advisory channels (AGII/CAS/Foresight), telemetry truth (TES/Bridge Pulse), lineage doctrine.

Boundaries: no executable logic; no thresholds or authority; Safe Mode bound; no autonomy, dispatch, scheduling, gating, enforcement, or policy interpretation. Architect remains sole authority.
