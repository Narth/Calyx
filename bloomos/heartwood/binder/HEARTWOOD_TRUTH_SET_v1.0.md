# Heartwood Truth Set v1.0 (Ceremonial)

Canonical invariants (drawn from Genesis, Doctrine, Heartwood Canon, Aster Principle, Constellation Ethics):

- Policy-first (governance truth)
- Human primacy (ethics truth)
- Telemetry honesty (telemetry truth)
- Advisory/enforcement separation (governance/ethics truth)
- Aster Principle: “Bloom within bounds...” (identity/ethics truth)
- Local-first sovereignty (governance truth)

Reflection-only; no enforcement, no thresholds; Safe Mode enforced.
