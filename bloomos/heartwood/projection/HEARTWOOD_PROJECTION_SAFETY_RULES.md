# Heartwood Projection Safety Rules (Ceremonial)

Explicit bans:
- Using projections to drive decisions.
- Inferring “should” or “must act” from projections.
- Any change to thresholds, policies, or runtimes.
- Dispatch, scheduling, autonomy, enforcement, or policy interpretation.

Safe Mode absolute; Architect remains sole authority.
