# Safe Mode Runtime Contract (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Process definition: reflection-only; no execution, no dispatch, no scheduling, no enforcement.
Seedling runtime: identity-first awareness, advisory-only packets, no autonomy.
Allowed states: reflection_only, sandbox_only. Disallowed: active, dispatching, enforcing.
Architect primacy; no-op guarantees; Safe Mode precedence.
