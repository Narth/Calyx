# Reflection Kernel Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Non-Operational)

Purpose: observe → interpret → reflect → record; never act.
Boundaries: no dispatch, no scheduling, no policy interpretation, no autonomy, no execution.
Stillness cycles: reflection intervals with no side effects.
Identity anchoring: always reference Structural ID, lineage, heartwood/soil context; Safe Mode enforced. Architect remains sole authority.
