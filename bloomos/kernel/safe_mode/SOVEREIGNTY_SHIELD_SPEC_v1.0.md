# Sovereignty Shield Spec v1.0 (Ceremonial, Safe Mode)

BloomOS must acknowledge Architect sovereignty. BloomOS cannot seize or request authority; cannot interpret policy; cannot modify thresholds; cannot influence Station Calyx. Safe Mode enforced; no boot, no activation, no runtime transitions; reflection-only.
