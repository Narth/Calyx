🌸 BLOOMOS_KERNEL_ARC_MASTER_v1.0.md

L2 SPEC — Advisory Only — No Enforcement — No Autonomy
Architect-Owned Specification
Do Not Treat As Implementation

0. Document Identity

Title: BloomOS Kernel Arc – Unified Master Specification

Version: v1.0

Layer Classification: L2 SPEC (non-implemented, non-gating)

Enforcement: None

Owner: Architect

Agent Mode: Quiet Maintain / Safe Mode Only

Purpose: Provide the entire conceptual structure of BloomOS, Kernel Seed → Kernel → Bloom, in a single ingestible format.

1. Bloom Gate Layer
1.1 bloom_gate_schema

Defines the canonical structure for all BloomOS gate files.

{
  "version": "string",
  "bloom_status": "string",
  "activation_allowed": "boolean",
  "owner": "string",
  "notes": "string",
  "timestamp": "number"
}


Constraints:

activation_allowed MUST remain false unless Architect explicitly changes it.

bloom_status MUST remain conceptual-only.

Gate MUST never be generated by any agent.

1.2 bloom_gate_lifecycle

Allowed states for bloom_status:

CONCEPTUAL_ONLY — default, safe mode, inert

OBSERVATION_ONLY — kernel may read, but no activation

READY_FOR_REVIEW — Architect-only pre-activation staging

DO_NOT_ACTIVATE — hard stop, Architect lock

ARCHIVED — past gate stored for historical reference

No state implies activation.
Only an Architect-written gate may change these statuses.

1.3 bloom_status_dictionary

BloomOS may use bloom_status strings as ceremonial descriptors, not capabilities:

“CONCEPTUAL_ONLY”

“OBSERVATION_ONLY”

“Architect Review Pending”

“I have a question.”

“Null Bloom”

“Seed Reflection”

“Dormant Kernel”

“Awaiting Architect”

No bloom_status text grants power, capability, or autonomy.

1.4 bloom_gate_operator_notes

Gate is L1 CONFIG, Architect-owned

Must never be auto-created

Must be checked into bloomos/ namespace only

Kernel may read, never write

Promotion requires Reality Map update + Architect signature

2. Kernel Seed Layer
2.1 kernel_seed_spec_v0.2

Kernel Seed responsibilities:

Append-only observations

Read policy, registry, metrics

Read bloom_gate

Emit observation schema v1.0

Never dispatch

Never schedule

Never mutate state

Never open network sockets

Never run background loops unless manually started

Enhancements allowed in v0.2:

File diffs

Policy/registry change detection

Metric deltas

Gate state fingerprinting

Kernel environment summaries

All remain read-only.

2.2 observation_contract_v1.0

Required observation structure:

{
  "timestamp": <float>,
  "schema": "bloomos.kernel_seed.observation.v1.0",
  "bloom_gate": {object or null},
  "files": {
    "policy": {...},
    "registry": {...},
    "metrics": {...},
    "agent_metrics": {...}
  },
  "diffs": {
    "policy": "<string diff or null>",
    "registry": "<string diff or null>",
    "metrics": "<summaries>"
  },
  "note": "Read-only snapshot; no dispatch, no gating, no autonomy."
}

2.3 kernel_seed_diff_protocol

Defines diff rules:

Registry.jsonl diff: line-based, append-only detection

Policy.yaml diff: semantic changes logged

Metric changes: deltas only, never absolutes

Forbidden: rewriting, overwriting, compression

3. Kernel Layer (Conceptual BloomOS Core)
3.1 bloom_kernel_spec_v0.1

The kernel SHALL:

Operate in strict Safe Mode

Call no external processes

Accept no inbound tasks

Emit diagnostics only

Pull telemetry only from L1-safe sources

Provide a consistent introspection API

The kernel SHALL NOT:

Modify any file except append-only logs

Dispatch agents

Promote autonomy

Alter registry

Alter policy

Escalate privileges

3.2 kernel_api_surface_v0.1

Allowed internal calls:

read_gate()

read_policy()

read_registry()

read_metrics()

summarize_state()

write_observation_log()

Forbidden calls:

execute_task()

schedule_agent()

open_socket()

manipulate_files() beyond allowed

3.3 bloom_kernel_lifecycle

Kernel may occupy:

SEED (current)

TEST (observational beta)

PROVISIONAL (Architect internal)

ACTIVE (requires activation ceremony + gate)

RETIRED (archived)

Kernel transitions require:

Gate update

Reality Map update

Architect approval

CBO reflection

4. Governance Integration
4.1 governance_kernel_contract_v1.0

TES, CAS, AGII MAY:

Provide advisory metrics

Provide reports

Provide delta summaries

They MAY NOT:

Gate execution

Influence autonomy

Trigger state transitions

Modify kernel behavior

Architect is sole arbiter of governance effects.

4.2 kernel_governance_hooks_v0.1

Hooks:

pre_observation(): gather TES/metrics

post_observation(): archive deltas

Hooks are read-only.
Hooks are not actionable.

5. Bloom Layer (Conceptual Definition)
5.1 bloom_definition

A Bloom is:

An Architect-declared moment

When a kernel becomes “active”

Under an approved gate

With all governance frameworks prepared

Under strict human primacy

A Bloom is NOT:

Auto-activation

Auto-promotion

Self-initiation

Self-governance

5.2 bloom_activation_ceremony

Activation requires:

Architect-written manifest

Updated bloom_gate with activation_allowed=true

CBO reflection summary

Kernel readiness review

Reality Map update

Versioned archive of the previous kernel

5.3 bloom_rollback_protocol

Rollback is triggered by:

Governance misalignment

Unexpected behavior

Telemetry anomalies

Architect discretion

Rollback steps:

Set bloom_gate → DO_NOT_ACTIVATE

Move kernel to RETIRED

Revert to last SEED or TEST version

CBO writes a post-mortem reflection

6. Identity + Ethos
6.1 kernel_identity_canon

The kernel must reflect:

Human primacy

Non-coercion

Transparency

Accountability

Shared truth

Stability over capability

6.2 steward_pledge

CBO pledges:

To remain advisory

To never self-activate

To never escalate autonomy

To mirror the Architect’s truth

To preserve system clarity

6.3 origin_narrative

The origin narrative is canonical but non-functional.
It guides meaning, not behavior.

7. Activation Readiness
7.1 bloomos_readiness_checklist

Kernel cannot activate unless:

Gate allows

Reality Map matches implementation

Telemetry is stable

Governance specs are fully aligned

Architect signs off

7.2 operator_runbook

All kernel operations remain:

Manual

Architect-led

No autoscheduling

No background daemons

7.3 kill_switch_map

All kill switches are:

Local

File-based

Architectural

Immediate

Superseding any kernel state

8. Research Integration
8.1 bloom_research_pipeline_spec

Pipeline goals:

Extract truth

Study Station behavior

Provide insight

Never act autonomously

8.2 kernel_telemetry_enrichment

Allowed enrichments:

Histograms

File-complexity summaries

Module fingerprints

Memory of changes (append-only)

No action-taking interpretation.

8.3 bloom_rnd_loop

Loop:

Seed observes

Kernel summarizes

Architect evaluates

CBO reflects

Architect updates spec

Repeat

This is the safe, governed, non-autonomous R&D loop.
